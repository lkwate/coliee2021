This issue had been canvassed by Astra, and Takeda's supplemental submissions could have been accomplished through one counsel. While Takeda's counsel's attendance at the hearing was necessary until counsel was called upon to argue, Takeda required only 4.5 hours out of 4.5 days to present its submissions.

Astra and Takeda are requesting that I depart from my choice of column under the Tariff. Such a request is entirely different from that made in\nConsorzio\n. While Mr. Justice D\u00e9cary (dissenting in part) had doubts about allowing a variation to provide for a lump sum, he was willing to consider it ( paras. 25-26).

However, in the context in which the comment was made, Mr. Justice Rothstein was referring to circumstances where the judgment did not include an order for costs. Justice Rothstein also stated that rule 403 is available in circumstances where the court has awarded \"costs\" without specification. In\nConsorzio\n, the court was ruling on a motion regarding an order for \"costs\". The word \"costs\", without more, lacks specificity. Absent indication to the contrary, under rules 407 and 400(5), this means costs according to column III of the table to Tariff B.

There were four patents involved and the record consisted of more than 30 volumes containing 8861 pages. Additional volumes of compendia were submitted during the hearing - 6 for Astra, 6 for Genpharm and 2 for Takeda. The memoranda of fact and law were lengthy - 75 pages for Astra and Genpharm and 34 pages for Takeda. Astra filed 73 authorities; Genpharm filed 39, and Takeda filed 15.

Specifically, they request that I direct that costs be assessed in accordance with the highest end of column V of Tariff B. They additionally request that directions issue to the assessment officer regarding various items of the tariff. In the alternative, they seek an extension of time to bring the motion under rule 397. At the hearing, counsel indicated that, while not withdrawing the alternative request, the applicants were \"hanging their hat\" on rule 403.\nThe motion under rule 397", "011": "[11]\nAstra and Takeda, by their submissions, seek to persuade me that the terms of my order are wrong or inappropriate in all of the circumstances. It is open to Astra and Takeda to take issue with my award of costs. It is their unqualified right to do so in the appropriate manner, i.e., by appealing my order. The purpose of rule 403 is to obtain precision with respect to costs:\nTrade Arbed Inc. v. Toles Ltd. et al.\n(2000), 196 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.). It does not provide an avenue to vary an order that specifies the costs to be awarded.\nConsiderations under rule 400(3)", "009": "[9]\nThe costs in the impugned order provide direction to the assessment officer because costs are awarded on the ordinary scale. Astra and Takeda do not suggest that the ordinary scale can be taken to mean anything other than column III. Thus, a motion for directions to assess under a different column is, in substance, nothing other than a motion for a variation of the judgment; it is not a request for directions. I refer to the comments of Mr. Justice Strayer in\nMinister of National Revenue v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.\n(2002), 289 N.R. 159 (F.C.A.), at paras. 1 and 2 wherein he stated:\n\"[...] In our judgment we dismissed the appeal 'with costs'.\n\"The respondent now appears to want the court to reconsider its judgment of December 21, 2001. The motion purports to be brought under rule 403 for 'directions' that the costs awarded are to include costs in other courts and in other proceedings. But what is now being sought is an award of costs which was not made by the court in its judgment. That is not permitted under rule 403.\"", "012": "[12]\nIn the event that I am wrong in my reasoning regarding the request for a direction that costs be assessed at the top end of column V of Tariff B, having now had the benefit of submissions in relation to costs, I would not be inclined to grant that request in any event.", "004": "[4]\nAdditionally, the stated basis for the motion is that the question of the scale of costs \"should have specifically been dealt with but was not\" (rule 397(1)(b)). There are two reasons why this submission fails. First, rule 400 does not require the court to specifically refer to a particular scale when awarding costs. Since costs were awarded in the order, it cannot be said that the issue of costs was overlooked or accidentally omitted. Second, by virtue of rule 407, column III of the table to Tariff B is the ordinary scale. Thus, my order did specify the scale. Even if I were persuaded that Astra and Takeda are correct that the scale must be specified, and I am not, rule 397(1)(b), which requires that a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or accidentally omitted, does not apply.\nThe motion under rule 403", "025": "[25]\nThe request in relation to item 24 relates to travel expenses for Takeda's counsel to attend the cross-examinations of Dr. Rowe and Dr. Brennan and for travel expenses for counsel to attend the hearing. Genpharm does not take issue with the first request, but argues that the second should be denied because the Requisition for Hearing indicated that the \"hearing should preferably be held in Toronto, although other cities such as Ottawa and Montreal are acceptable\". Since Takeda did not dispute this choice of venue, Genpharm maintains that it should not be liable to Takeda for its travel costs. In my view, parties should not be penalized for indicating a willingness to be flexible. Two counsel were based in Toronto and one was based in Ottawa. It was inevitable that someone would have to travel. It is not unreasonable that Takeda's counsel be permitted to claim economy class airfare between Ottawa and Toronto as a travel expense for his attendance at both the cross-examinations of Dr. Rowe and Dr. Brennan as well as for his attendance at the hearing.", "001": "[1]\nLayden-Stevenson, J.\n: This motion arises out of my judgment dated December 11, 2003 [see 243 F.T.R. 6], wherein I granted the applicants' application for an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a notice of compliance (NOC) to Genpharm with respect to its 10 mg and 20 mg omeprazole capsules until after expiration of the four patents that were in issue.

He concluded that, in relation to the high volume of work and the greater expenses involved, the costs reflecting those consequences should not be expected to be borne by the defendants.

Neither Astra nor Takeda have provided evidence of a continuing intention to pursue the requested relief.

It held at pages 11 to 15 that:\n\"1. the Veterans Affairs Canada Entitlement Eligibility Guidelines for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder indicate that the individual must have been exposed to a traumatic event which involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity to the applicant or others so that the individual's response involved intense fear, helplessness or horror;\n\"2. the Board is required under s. 35(2) of the\nPension Act\nto assess the disability based on these Guidelines;\n\"3. the Board found that the applicant's military activity did not involve such a traumatic event;\n\"4. these Guidelines adopt the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV Edition (DSM-IV), which has defined PTSD as a psychiatric condition if it meets six criteria. The first of which is set out as follows:\n'A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which:\ni. The person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others; and\nii. The person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror; [...]'\n\"5. the Board found that the Psychologist's opinion does not accord with the definition of PTSD and is therefore not credible as the basis for the pension award;\n\"6. the Board found that the applicants are to be given the benefit of the doubt in the weighing of evidence in accordance with ss. 3 and 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n. However, the benefit of the doubt does not lead the Board to accept automatically whatever submission is made by the veteran. The evidence must be credible and it must be reasonable. The Board implicitly found that the applicant had not established a reasonable doubt;\n\"7. the Board also found PTSD is a condition which emerges from military combat, and to a lesser degree, personal violence and serious physical injuries in civilian life. PTSD cannot be extended to cover the circumstances of the applicant's case which is to accept that non-violent administrative activities caused PTSD;\n\"8. finally, if the diagnosis of PTSD is correct, then it would have to be based on evidence that would include the complete history of the applicant's life so that the Board could assess whether or not it was related or aggravated by military service; and\n\"9. since the Board did not accept the diagnosis of PTSD as claimed by the applicant, the Board made no finding as to whether the alleged disability arose out of or was directly connected to his military service.\"\nRelevant Legislation", "008": "[8]\nOn May 27, 2004, an Appeal Panel of the Board dismissed the applicant's appeal from the decision of the Entitlement Review Panel.

Military combat, a violent personal assault, being taken hostage, torture, and incarceration as a prisoner of war are personal traumatic events which can trigger PTSD.

Canada (Attorney General)\n, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 113; 146 A.C.W.S.(3d) 366 (F.C.), I undertook a functional and pragmatic analysis to conclude that the standard on which to review the Veterans Review and Appeal Board deciding pension claim is patent unreasonableness for questions of fact, and reasonableness simpliciter for questions of mixed fact and law. I held at paragraphs 11 to 14:\n\"\u00b6 11 For the first factor, the presence of s. 31 of the\nVRAB Act\n, which deems decisions made by the Board to be final and binding, means that the Board's decisions attract curial deference.\n\"\u00b6 12 For the second factor, the Board has a greater relative expertise in deciding pension claims than does the Court. As a result, deference is owed to the Board's determination of factual questions.\n\"\u00b6 13 The third factor is the purpose of the legislation; in this case, the applicable legislation is the\nVRAB Act\nand the\nPension Act\n. The purpose of the\nPension Act\n, as identified in the preamble, is to 'provide pensions and other benefits to the members of the forces'. A liberal interpretation of the\nVRAB Act\nis mandated by s. 3, with the aim of recognizing the Crown's obligation to members of the forces and their dependents. These purposes favour deference to the Board's decisions.\n\"\u00b6 14 With respect to the nature of the question, the Court will treat the Board's factual findings with more deference than its interpretation of legal principles.

The etiology appears related directly to his perceived mistreatment by the military, which he describes as including physical imprisonment, psychological torture, a serious accident while under suspension and ongoing harassment.\"\nAccordingly, Dr. Furman found that the applicant has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and that its etiology or causation \"appears related directly to his perceived mistreatment by the military\".", "025": "[25]\nSection 35(2) of the\nPension Act\nprovides that the assessment of the applicant's disability\nshall\nbe based on the instructions and a table of disabilities made by the Minister for guidance to persons making those assessments.

First, as at the date of the implementation of the UCRCC program, the class in question was not small: it was estimated to include approximately 7,500 refugees in Canada whose country of origin was Somalia or Afghanistan and who had not been granted permanent residence due to a lack of satisfactory identity docu\u00adments. That number does not reflect the number of dependants both within Canada and outside Canada who had not themselves been found to be Convention refugees. Second, the government was contemplating the reduction of the waiting period for mem\u00adbers of the UCRCC from five years to three years. Third, the class hardly benefits depen\u00addants outside Canada. Fourth, the waiting period was intended to be used to allow identification of non-deserving claimants. There was no evidence before the Court in this matter to demonstrate that the waiting period had been so used by the respondent in the case of the principal applicant.

On the facts of this matter, there were at least three decisions within the context of the \"non-decision\" or \"course of conduct\"; two rejections of ident\u00adity documents prior to the date of filing of the application for judicial review, and a further rejection of an identity document following commencement of the application.

Is a passport, however issued by an applicant's country of citizenship, sufficient for the purposes of ss. 46.04(8) of the\nImmigration Act\n, or may an immigration officer have reference to the underlying process for issuance in determining whether to accept it for the purposes of the subsection?\n\"3. Is it a reviewable error for an immigration officer to retain documents seized under ss. 110 of the\nImmigration Act\nin order to facilitate the carrying out of any provisions of the\nImmigration Act\nor\nRegulations\n, including the potential future removal of the document holder, and then not to submit those documents for verification where their authenticity may be in doubt?\"", "023": "[23]\nA Regulatory Impact Analysis State\u00adment related to amendments to the\nImmigra\u00adtion Regulations\n, 1978 that amended the definition \"member of the undocumented Convention refugee in Canada class\" in 1999 [see footnote 3] provides some insight as to why the UCRCC was developed and the objectives to which it is directed. The Regu\u00adlatory Impact Analysis Statement reads in part as follows:\n\"Paragraph 114(1)(e) of the\nImmigration Act\nallows the Governor-in-Council to create classes of immigrants and to pre\u00adscribe landing requirements in regulation in order to grant permanent resident status (landing) to persons on public policy or compassionate or humanitarian grounds. These amendments renew Schedule XII of the\nImmmigration Regulations\n, 1978, i.e., the country list to which the regulations apply, as well as the sunset clause con\u00adtained in the Regulations.\n\"The Undocumented Convention Refugees in Canada Class (UCRCC) was created as a class for public policy reasons. The creation of this class allows for the grant of permanent residence to undocumented refugees from specified countries \u2013 cur\u00adrently Somalia and Afghanistan. Special provision has been made for citizens of these countries in recognition of the fact that extreme turmoil exists within both countries and that that turmoil has pre\u00advented and continues to prevent refugees who are citizens or nationals of Somalia and Afghanistan from complying with the current legislative requirement for passport, travel document or other satisfactory ident\u00adity document before being granted perma\u00adnent residence in Canada. In both these cases, the lack of an effective central gov\u00adernment has meant that, for some time, no reliable identity documents, in any official form, have been available to citizens or nationals of the two countries.\n. . . . .\n\"Since there no exception to the require\u00adment for an identity document, a growing number of Convention refugees who lacked a satisfactory identity document were not granted permanent residence status. Prior to the creation of the UCRCC Class, many faced indefinite and possibly perpetual inability to comply with the requirements for permanent residence status. A refugee lacking a satisfactory identity document could not sponsor the admission to Canada of immediate family members who remain abroad, could never aspire to Canadian citizenship, and would not as a result, ever become fuly inter\u00adgrated into Canadian society. At the time the UCRCC provisions were implemented, it was estimated that there were approxi\u00admately 7,500 refugees in Canada whose country of origin was Somalia or Afghanistan and who had not been granted permanent residence due to lack of a satis\u00adfactory identity document.\n\"It was recognized that the great majority of persons in this situation were genuine refugees who, through no fault of their own, were unable to obtain an identity document from their country of origin due to existence within the country of turmoil to the extent that there was (and still is) no central authority in place able to issue identity documents. It was also recognized that our desire to facilitate landing for refugees from such countries must be balanced with our commitment to protect Canada from the small majority of individ\u00aduals who would willfully conceal their identity or country of origin, for the pur\u00adpose of hiding information that could adversely affect their entitlement to protec\u00adtion in Canada. In this regard, UCRCC class applicants are required to make a solemn declaration regarding the accuracy and completeness of the information pro\u00advided with respect to identity. This declar\u00adation confirms that the information is consistent with that provided to the Refu\u00adgee Division when the refugee claim was made, or identifies and explains any differ\u00adences between the information provided now and that provided at the time of the refugee claim.\n\"A principal eligibility criterion for UCRCC is the passage of a significant period of time from the date of determina\u00adtion of Convention refugee status. The current waiting period is of five years. As part of new directions for immigration and refugee policy and legislation, announced on January 6, 1999, the government is proposing balanced measures to strengthen the refugee protection system while main\u00adtaining the safety of Canadian society, including the reduction of the waiting period for undocumented refugees from five to three years.\n\"The waiting period provides a necessary balance between providing protection to those individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution and safeguarding Canada and Canadians against those individuals who would abuse Canada's generosity by willfully concealing their identities in order to hide a criminal past or conceal their true country of origin.\nThe waiting period allows the opportunity of detecting, often with the assistance of the communities of which they are members, those with his\u00adtories of criminality, human rights abuses, or other activities that would exclude them from the benefits to which refugees are entitled under the United Nations Conven\u00adtion relating to the status of Refugees (Geneva Convention)\n. As well the passage of time allows for these refugees to estab\u00adlish their ongoing willingness to respect the laws and norms of Canadian society. Assessment of their conduct during this time in Canada serves as a substitute for the background checks that are conducted on all immigrants, including refugees, since background checks are of limited effectiveness when the name of the indi\u00advidual cannot be confirmed or any of the personal information corroborated by official records.\n\"To be eligible for consideration for mem\u00adbership in the class, the person must: have been determined to be a Convention refu\u00adgee in Canada; have not had his or her Convention refugee determination revoked; be a national of, or, if stateless, a former habitual resident of a country recognized as in turmoil and therefore unable to issue identity documents; have applied for per\u00admanent residence under the regular appli\u00adcation process in place for persons deter\u00admined to be Convention refugees; have paid all applicable fees associated with that application; and, not have been granted permanent residence for the sole reason of lack of a satisfactory identity document (for example, there are no serious criminal\u00adity or security barriers to the granting of permanent residence).\n\"A member of the Class is eligible to include in the UCRCC application for permanent residence only those dependants who were included on the original applica\u00adtion for permanent residence and who have resided in Canada since the time of that application. An exception to the require\u00adment that dependants have been residing in Canada since the time of that application is provided for any eligible dependants who came to Canada before the date on which public notice of the Government's intent to create the Class was given (November 16, 1996). This provision differs from the current rule respecting inclusion of depend\u00adants of Convention refugees in applications for landing pursuant to subsection 46.04(1) of the\nAct\n. It was introduced in recognition of the fact that these refugees are adversely affected by lack of documentary proof of relationship. Because of the inordinate processing delays that would otherwise result, the non-inclusion of dependants outside of Canada is intended to facilitate the earliest possible conclusion of the application for permanent residence under this class for the member and any depend\u00adants in Canada.\" (emphasis added)\n\"L'alin\u00e9a 114(1)(e) de la\nLoi sur l'immi\u00adgration\nautorise le gouverneur en conseil \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des cat\u00e9gories d'immigrants et \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser par r\u00e8glement des exigences rela\u00adtives \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement afin d'accorder le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent (l'\u00e9tablisse\u00adment) pour des motifs humanitaires ou d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.

Dans le cadre de nouvelles orientations pour la politique et la l\u00e9gislation relatives aux immigrants et aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s annonc\u00e9es le 6 janvier 1999, le gouvernement propose un ensemble coh\u00e9rent de mesures visant \u00e0 renforcer le syst\u00e8me de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s tout en assurant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Canadiens; ces mesures propos\u00e9es comprennent la r\u00e9duc\u00adtion de cinq \u00e0 trois ans de la p\u00e9riode d'at\u00adtente pour la cat\u00e9gorie des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s sans papiers.\n\"La p\u00e9riode d'attente garantit l'\u00e9quilibre n\u00e9cessaire entre notre obligation d'offrir notre protection \u00e0 des personnes qui craig\u00adnent avec raison d'\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es et notre obligation de prot\u00e9ger les Canadiens contre ceux qui voudraient abuser de notre g\u00e9n\u00ad\u00e9rosit\u00e9 en cachant sciemment leur identit\u00e9 pour dissimuler un pass\u00e9 criminel ou leur vrai pays d'origine.\nCette p\u00e9riode nous donne la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9tecter, souvent avec l'aide des collectivit\u00e9s auxquelles appartiennent ces personnes, celles qui ont un pass\u00e9 criminel, ont commis des viol\u00adations des droits de la personne ou sont impliqu\u00e9es dans d'autres activit\u00e9s qui les excluraient des avantages reconnus aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s par la Convention des Nations Unies relative au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (Con\u00advention de Gen\u00e8ve)\n. Les ann\u00e9es d'attente permettent \u00e9galement \u00e0 ces r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s de d\u00e9montrer qu'ils sont d\u00e9sireux de respecter les lois canadiennes et les r\u00e8gles de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L'\u00e9valuation de leur comportement pendant cette p\u00e9riode au Canada remplace la v\u00e9rification des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents normalement effectu\u00e9e pour tous les immigrants, y compris les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'efficacit\u00e9 de ce genre de v\u00e9rification est limit\u00e9e si ni le nom de la personne vis\u00e9e ni les renseignements personnels la concer\u00adnant ne peuvent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s par des registres officiels.\n\"Pour \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie des RCCSPI, l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 doit satisfaire aux conditions suivantes: le statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu au Canada; le statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9; l'int\u00e9r\u00adess\u00e9 est un ressortissant d'un pays reconnu comme \u00e9tant en plein bouleversement et donc incapable de d\u00e9livrer des documents d'identit\u00e9, ou, s'il est apatride, il avait ant\u00e9rieurement sa r\u00e9sidence habituelle dans un tel pays; il a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9sidence permanente en suivant les formalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9v\u00adues pour les personnes auxquelles le statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu, a pay\u00e9 tous les droits exigibles pour l'examen de cette demande, et n'a pas re\u00e7u le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent pour le seul motif qu'il ne peut fournir un docu\u00adment d'identit\u00e9 acceptable (par exemple, il n'y a pas de motifs s\u00e9rieux de criminalit\u00e9 ou de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui emp\u00eachent de lui accorder la r\u00e9sidence permanente.)\n\"Les membres de la cat\u00e9gorie des RCCSPI n'ont le droit d'inclure dans leur demande de r\u00e9sidence permanente que les personnes \u00e0 leur charge qui \u00e9taient incluses dans la demande originale de r\u00e9sidence permanente et qui ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada depuis cette premi\u00e8re demande.

In the event, the identity documents were never forwarded to \"Intelli\u00adgence\" for verification of the respondent's concerns. Material before the Court indicates that this failure to seek verification or \"feed\u00adback\" was not discovered and disclosed to the principal applicant for many, many months. As late as the 21st of January, 2000, in response to written questions posed to the respondent's affiant in this matter, the affiant replied:\n\"The documents that were seized were fowarded to our Regional Intelligence Office on September 14, 1998 and feed\u00adback was requested as to the erasures and information that was written over the documents. I have not received any feed\u00adback to date.\"\nNo feedback was received because, in truth, the documents were never submitted for verification or feedback.", "044": "[44]\nI am satisfied that precisely the same can be said here. To paraphrase the words of Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, it would be unfair for a person or persons subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to the future of the principal appli\u00adcant and his family members not to be told why the result was reached. On this basis as well, I am satisfied that the respondent erred in a reviewable manner in not providing reasons for the rejection of the various ident\u00adity documents provided by him, other than the marriage certificate and identity booklet where reasons were provided.", "005": "[5]\nThe principal applicant's wife and children, the co-applicants herein, were included in the principal applicant's applica\u00adtion.", "026": "[26]\nDespite this application, the process is ongoing. In an affidavit sworn the 10th of December, 1999, the respondent's affiant attests:\n\"Currently, his [the principal applicant's] application is pending the results of his security and criminal clearances. The applicant's landing will be authorized when the CSIS and RCMP results are received as having been passed. As of the date of this affidavit, the results of the background checks have not yet been received.\"", "055": "[55]\nAn unsigned copy of these reasons was distributed to counsel who were invited to consider the issue of certification of a question and to provide written representations to be followed by a teleconference if required.", "021": "[21]\nIn the meantime, more than five years after the principal applicant was determined under Canadian law to be a Convention refugee as against Afghanistan, his wife and children, whom he had not seen for over six years as of the 30th of March, 1999, con\u00adtinue to languish in limbo in Pakistan. The principal applicant himself remains in sus\u00adpended animation in Canada. His children continue to grow older. One of his children is now of an age where he can no longer sponsor that child as a dependant. Another apparently approaches that age.\nCONTEXT", "032": "[32]\nThe interview of the principal applicant on the 20th of April, 1998 is of critical importance to my determination herein. The only sworn evidence that is before the Court as to what transpired at that interview comes from the principal applicant himself. The interviewing officer's notes of the interview, contained in the tribunal record, are to the following effect:\n\"Unable to land subject this date as identi\u00adfication presented unacceptable. He pres\u00adented Afghanistani driver's license which does not provide proof of citizenship, country of birth or date of birth. He also presented an Afghanistani passport which was issued in New York in March 1996.\nHe stated that this passport was issued on the basis of his Canadian social insurance card\n.\" (emphasis added)", "038": "[38]\nAs noted earlier in these reasons, the applicant was advised by letter dated the 23rd of January, 1996 that additional identity documentation was required. A copy of a passport was specifically identified as appro\u00adpriate identity documentation. The principal applicant applied through the Afghan Consu\u00adlate General in New York City for an Afghan passport and obtained one. It was valid from the 11th of March, 1996 to the 10th of March, 1997. Counsel for the appli\u00adcant forwarded a notarized copy of the passport to the respondent under cover of a letter dated the 21st of March, 1996, clearly at a time when the passport was \"subsisting\".", "054": "[54]\nCounsel for the applicants urged that, on the particular facts of this matter, there can be found special reasons for ordering costs in favour of the principal applicant. Counsel urged that those costs should be fixed in the amount of $4,000. Counsel for the respondent urged that there are no special reasons for an order of costs on this application. I favour the view of counsel for the applicant as to the existence of special reasons. The record before the Court discloses a lack of sensitivity and responsiveness to the interests of the principal applicant and his family members which appears only to have been alleviated, and then only partially and reluctantly, by the institution of this application. That being said, I will order that costs be payable by the respondent to the principal applicant fixed in the amount of $2,000.00, inclusive of disbursements.\nCERTIFICATION OF A QUESTION", "017": "[17]\nThe visa officer's comments disclose that the respondent applies different stan\u00addards in the determination of satisfactory identification in cases such as this, in differ\u00adent circumstances. I find it of interest to note that, in Islamabad, much closer to the reality of the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the principal applicant's documentation was found to be much above the average for persons fleeing Afghanistan. A different, and obviously much more stringent standard was applied within the safety and security of the boundaries of Canada.", "015": "[15]\nThe principal applicant was further advised through a staff member in the office of a Member of Parliament, in early Octo\u00adber, 1998, about the seizure of his docu\u00adments and about the respondent's concerns with those documents. The staff member apparently advised the respondent by letter dated the 28th of October, 1998 that rela\u00adtives of the principal applicant were willing to attest to his identity. Apparently no response was received. Nonetheless, the principal applicant forwarded to the respon\u00addent an affidavit sworn by his brother attest\u00ading to the principal applicant's identity. No acknowledgement of receipt of this affidavit was provided.", "010": "[10]\nOn the 9th of April, 1998, the principal applicant was advised by the respondent that he was scheduled for a \"landing appoint\u00adment\" on the 20th of April, 1998 at the Canada Immigration Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario. The principal applicant attended the scheduled \"landing appointment\". He was requested at the appointment to provide \"personal identification\" before a record of landing would be issued. The principal applicant displayed to the interviewing officer the originals of his now expired Afghan passport, his Afghan driver's licence with a translation, his Ontario driver's licence card and his Ontario provincial health insurance card. The principal appli\u00adcant's Afghan driver's licence that he dis\u00adplayed during the landing appointment had been submitted as proof of his identity dur\u00ading his Convention Refugee Determination Division hearing in 1994, and its authenticity had apparently been found to be satisfactory.", "008": "[8]\nBy letter dated the 15th of July, 1996, counsel for the principal applicant enquired of the respondent whether any additional documentation was required. In response, by facsimile dated the 22nd of July, 1996, the respondent indicated no dissatisfaction with the notarized copy of the principal appli\u00adcant's passport and further that:\n\"It appears all we are waiting for are the results of the overseas checks for [the applicant's] dependants.\"", "061": "[61]\nFor the foregoing reasons, and particularly because certification of more than one question is not required in order for a full argument on an appeal, neither the second nor the third question will be certified.\nApplication allowed.", "035": "[35]\nOnce again, the identity documents in question are not identified. Further, as noted earlier in these reasons, not all identity documents submitted were seized, and no follow-up or feedback was ever requested with respect to the documents that were seized despite the fact that the \"seizure form[s]\" indicate that feedback had been requested.", "047": "[47]\nThe decisions of the respondent to reject the valid and subsisting passport sub\u00admitted by the principal applicant in support of his application for landing and that of his dependants pursuant to section 46.04 of the\nImmigration Act\nand the various other identity documents submitted by him, other than his identity booklet and marriage certifi\u00adcate, are set aside and are referred back to the respondent for determination in accord\u00adance with law as interpreted in these reasons. Given the time that has elapsed since the original application by the principal applicant and his dependants, the respondent is urged to make the redetermination, and to provide the principal applicant with reasons for the result of the redetermination, as expeditious\u00adly as possible.", "013": "[13]\nOn or about the 14th of September, 1998, the respondent wrote to the applicant to advise that the additional identity docu\u00admentation he had submitted was not satisfac\u00adtory, that the respondent was stopping the processing on his immigration file, and that his identity booklet and marriage certificate had been seized pursuant to subsection 110\u00ad(2) of the\nImmigration Act\n. While the principal applicant's expired Afghan passport and Afghan driver's licence were apparently not formally seized, they were not returned to him. Material from the remarkably sparse tribunal record on this application indicates that both the marriage certificate and the identity booklet submitted by the principal applicant\n\"... contain alteration (sic) which render them unacceptable for the purposes of A46.04.\n\"The marriage certificate contains white-out (sic) and write-overs in the age at time of marriage section.\n\"The Identity Document has erasures and overwriting ...\n\"Documents will be seized and forwarded to Intelligence for review and observation.\"", "039": "[39]\nAt the interview of the principal appli\u00adcant on the 20th of April, 1998, the principal applicant presented the original of the pass\u00adport, then no longer \"subsisting\", to the interviewing officer. According to the of\u00adficer's notes that appear in the Tribunal Record, the passport was rejected as an identity document, presumably because it was issued \"... on the basis of [the principal applicant's] Canadian Social Insurance Card.", "056": "[56]\nCounsel for the applicant proposed no question and indicated that he would oppose certification of any question that might be proposed on behalf of the respondent.", "006": "[6]\nBy letter dated the 23rd of January, 1996, more than a year after the principal applicant's application, the principal appli\u00adcant was advised that he was required to provide additional identity documentation. A copy of a passport was specifically identified as appropriate identity documentation.", "043": "[43]\nIn\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n[see footnote 7], Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, in the context of an application for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compas\u00adsionate grounds, wrote at p. 848:\n\"In my opinion, it is now appropriate to recognize that, in certain circumstances, the duty of procedural fairness will require the provision of a written explanation for a decision. The strong arguments demon\u00adstrating the advantages of written reasons suggest that, in cases such as this where the decision has important significance for the individual, when there is statutory right of appeal, or in other circumstances, some form of reasons should be required. This requirement has been developing in the common law elsewhere. The circumstances of the case at bar, in my opinion constitute one of the situations where reasons are necessary. The profound importance of an H&C decision to those affected, ... mili\u00adtates in favour of a requirement that rea\u00adsons be provided. It would be unfair for a person subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to their future not to be told why the result was reached.\" (citations omitted)", "020": "[20]\nWithout forsaking his efforts to be landed under the provisions of section 46.04 of the\nImmigration Act\n, the principal appli\u00adcant filed an application to be landed as a member of the UCRCC on the 19th of July, 1999, some three months after the time when he was first eligible to file such an applica\u00adtion. On the 21st of September, 1999, the principal applicant was granted approval in principle for landing as a member of that class. He remained not landed at the date of hearing of this application, while \"back\u00adground and security checks\" are being con\u00adducted.", "002": "[2]\nThe applicants seek the following reliefs:\n\"1.

The seizure of those documents was purportedly effected under subsection 110(2) of the\nImmigration Act\n. The relevant por\u00adtions of that subsection read as follows:\n\"(2) An immigration officer may\n. . . . .\n(b) seize and hold at a port of entry or any other place in Canada any thing or document if the immigration officer believes on reasonable grounds that that action is required to facilitate the carry\u00ading out of any provision of this Act or the regulations; and\"\n\"(2) L'agent d'immigration a le pouvoir:\n. . . . .\nb) de saisir et retenir, \u00e0 un point d'entr\u00e9e ou ailleurs au Canada, tous objets ou documents, lorsqu'il a des motifs raison\u00adnables de croire qu'une telle mesure s'impose pour faciliter l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi et de ses r\u00e8glements;\"\nWhile the seizure may have been appropriate as being \"... required to facilitate the carry\u00ading out of any provision of this\nAct\nor the\nRegulations\n\", there is no evidence before the Court that the documents were so used after their seizure given that they were never submitted for verification. In the circum\u00adstances, regardless of whatever worth these documents might have to the principal appli\u00adcant, I can see no justification for the con\u00adtinued retention by the respondent. [see footnote 8]", "053": "[53]\nIn the result, I will set aside the decisions of the respondent to reject the valid and subsisting passport submitted by the principal applicant and the various other identity documents submitted by him other than his identity booklet and marriage certificate. Those decisions will be referred back to the respondent for redetermination in accordance with law as interpreted in these reasons. I will order return to the principal applicant of the identity documents submitted by him and still in the respondent's possession, however suspect they may or may not be. In addition, I will provide a declaration in the terms set out earlier in these reasons.\nCOSTS", "049": "[49]\nQuashing or setting aside \"non-deci\u00adsions\" is very close in nature to mandamus and, for reasons that follow, I am not sat\u00adisfied that such relief is appropriate here. On the other hand, a form of declaration is I am satisfied, justified.", "011": "[11]\nThe principal applicant was advised that the documentation he had provided and displayed was not satisfactory. He was requested to obtain other identification docu\u00adments such as an original marriage certificate or a birth certificate. He was advised that his record of landing would be issued only upon provision of satisfactory identification. This, some 39 or 40 months after his application for landing and more than two years after the notarized copy of the passport was pro\u00advided to the respondent.", "034": "[34]\nAs indicated earlier in these reasons, the respondent again wrote to the principal applicant on the 14th of September, 1998.

It has been determined that these documents do not meet Immigration re\u00adquirements in supporting your identity. Moreover, the documents have been seized as per Section 110(2) of the Immigration Act.

No response was received until the 9th of April, 1998.", "012": "[12]\nThe principal applicant arranged to have his original marriage certificate and original identity booklet sent by courier from his family in Pakistan. He also arranged to have those documents translated into English. After some delay following the transfer of his file between offices of the respondent, the original of the principal applicant's expired passport, his Afghan driver's licence, his marriage certificate with translation, and his identity booklet with translation were provided to the respondent. This was appar\u00adently at about the end of July, 1998.", "059": "[59]\nAgainst the foregoing guidance, I am satisfied that the first question proposed on behalf of the respondent, with one modification, warrants certification. Relief in the nature of certiorari is not the only relief that will be granted in this matter and thus, if the question were related only to relief in the nature of certiorari, as proposed on behalf of the respondent, arguably at least, the answer to the question would not be dispositive of an appeal.

In\nKrause et al. v. Canada et al.\n[see footnote 6], Mr. Justice Stone, for the Court, wrote at paragraph 21:\n\"The appellants point out that the drafters of section 18.1 employed language else\u00adwhere in its text which, in their sub\u00admission, is designed to accommodate an application for both a section 18 remedy per se and such other remedy as is pro\u00advided for in subsection 18.1(3). Thus in subsection 18.1(1), the words 'anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought' appear. The Motions judge ... was of the view that the word 'matter' as repeated in former Rule 1602 is 'reflective ... of the necessity to find a word to cover a variety of adminis\u00adtrative actions.' I respectfully agree. Fur\u00adther support for that view was expressed after Bill C-38 which proposed this change was adopted, but before it came into force. Indeed, it seems to me that the word 'mat\u00adter' does embrace not only a 'decision or order' but any matter in respect of which a remedy may be available under section 18 of the\nFederal Court Act\n.\" (citation omitted)\nAt paragraph 23, Mr. Justice Stone wrote:\n\"In my view, the time limit imposed by subsection 18.1(2) does not bar the appel\u00adlants from seeking relief by way of mandamus, prohibition and declaration.\"\nFinally, at paragraph 24, the Court wrote:\n\"I am satisfied that the exercise of the jurisdiction under section 18 does not depend on the existence of a 'decision or order'.\"", "060": "[60]\nCertification of the first question in effect makes certification of the second and third proposed questions superfluous. That is not to say that I regard the second and third questions as being other than questions of broad significance or general application. But I am concerned that either of the second or third questions would not, of itself, be dispositive of an appeal in this matter. Further, the third question presupposes a purpose in retaining seized documents that had no evidentiary basis before me. There was simply nothing before the Court to indicate that the seized documents that continued to be retained by the respondent at the time of the hearing of this matter were being held to facilitate the potential future removal of the principal applicant. The only purpose for the seizure and detention of the documents disclosed in the evidence before the Court was for purposes of verification of their authenticity.", "051": "[51]\nClearly there is a balance to be struck between the objectives reflected in paragraphs (f) and (g) quoted above and those reflected in paragraphs (i) and (j). On the facts of this matter, I am satisfied that the balance has been skewed to an unreasonable extent in favour of objectives (i) and (j) without any evidence being provided to the Court that those objectives have been diligently pursued in dealing with the situation of the principal applicant and his family members.

Identity documents thought to be less than adequate were never sent for verifica\u00adtion when they should have been and were alleged to have been. The difference in philosophy demonstrated in the communica\u00adtion from a visa officer in the respondent's ministry in Islamabad from the philosophy reflected in the actions or inactions of officers in the same ministry here in Canada appears to have been dramatic.

Since flight risk is the consideration, the Board must ask whether involvement in a people smuggling or trafficking operation would lead a person in the circumstances of the Respondent to not appear. As well, subsection (g) requires the Board to consider the existence of strong community ties in Canada as a factor in assessing the existence of a flight risk.", "019": "[19]\nThe issue of whether the Board erred by failing to apply the factors set out in subsections 245(f) and (g) is a question of law and reviewable on the standard of correctness. The alleged failure of the Board to consider whether the Respondent will appear for a removal order is an issue of mixed law and fact; see\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. X\n.

The Board found that the Applicant's allegation of the Respondent's membership in the LTTE is not straightforward, thereby giving the Respondent an incentive to present himself for the admissibility hearing. The Board found that the flight risk that could arise from the potential of an eventual removal order could be mitigated by strong terms and conditions.", "047": "[47]\nThe Applicant argues that since the Respondent has no connections in Canada, the Board's decision to release him on minimal terms, is unreasonable.

In circumstances where the seller itself thinks the product \"meets specifications\", at least in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I do not think that this court should conclude otherwise.

It is true that the evidence indicates that Novopharm itself did at least two analyses on samples of the bulk enalapril maleate received by it from Delmar. The first of those analyses, conducted shortly after Novopharm took delivery, might serve to indicate that the bulk enalapril maleate was not at that time up to standards satisfactory to the Health Protection Branch. Whether that be true or not, there certainly was no evidence before me that Novopharm refused to accept delivery of the bulk enalapril maleate or in any way indicated that Delmar had failed to fulfil the conditions of Novopharm's purchase order.", "003": "[3]\nThe specified delivery date was the 15th of October, 1990.

Nevertheless, I am persuaded, as the plaintiffs submit, that the enalapril maleate delivered to Apotex in these three lots could not be said to be in existence for purposes of the statutory immunity until the product was considered by Delmar to be of such a quality that the manufacturer would ship it under the contract for purchase by Apotex. Only when it was deemed to be of proper quality could it be considered to be purchased or acquired by Apotex within the meaning of s. 56 [of the\nPatent Act\n]. Since it was not judged by the supplier in these cases to be of that quality until after the issue of the patent to Merck in mid-October, 1990, each of those lots of bulk enalapril maleate could not be said to be in existence at that date.'\n\"I agree with the trial judge that the three lots of enalapril maleate had not been 'purchased or acquired' by Apotex, within the meaning of s. 56. In my view, purchasers cannot be said to have 'purchased or acquired' a product until they have obtained title to it. Since we were shown no evidence of a contrary intention in the contract between Apotex and Delmar, title could not pass to Apotex until the product was in a deliverable state: see s. 19, rule 5 of the\nSale of Goods Act\n, R.S.O. 1990, c. S-1. In circumstances where the seller itself thought that the product was unsuitable for delivery, I do not think this court should conclude otherwise.\n\"It is true, as Apotex submitted, that enalapril maleate was in existence even before the lots were repurified. Moreover, as I have pointed out, the form taken by an invention is not governing for the purposes of s. 56. Thus, if Apotex had purchased or acquired enalapril maleate in any form, whether pure bulk powder, tablets, or some other combination of enalapril maleate and another substance, it could be said to have acquired Merck's invention within the meaning of s. 56. However, in the case at bar, the product which Apotex sought to purchase or acquire was\npure\npowder.

The Minister, after a subsequent request, filed the material under seal in the court in order that the matter could be determined by a judge, but gave no reasons for the objection in writing. I am unable to agree that the drug supplier's rights should be affected by reason of the failure of the Minister to object in the manner specified in rule 1613.

That type of proceeding is an ancient norm in common law courts and during the time of the reforms in the judicature in the United Kingdom, adopted here, examination for discovery, orally and examination for discovery of documents have been added to the process. So the result there is that one may have a proceeding in which there is discovery, and there may be surprise witnesses or surprise testimony from those witnesses, even at trial, although discovery is meant to smooth out that possibility or diminish that risk.\n\"Here the applicant has chosen a form of proceeding which was more common in the Chancery courts, and that is an originating notice of motion. This proceeding is a summary proceeding, unlike the other. It is summary in that there is no discovery and no written pleadings. Applications may be supported and deposed by affidavit and the opposing parties may cross-examine on those affidavits.

In\nFranklyn\n, above, Justice Yves de Montigny states the following, at paragraphs 25-27:\n\"In the circumstances of this case, I do not think that it was objectively reasonable to expect the applicant to have further sought the protection from the police after having been rebuffed or ignored previously. Considering the poor record of St-Vincent and the Grenadines with respect to the protection of assaulted women, it is not difficult to conceive of the enormous difficulties a woman with unorthodox sexual practices is likely to encounter in complaining about the physical abuses she has been subjected to. For these reasons, and applying the reasonableness simpliciter standard of review, I believe the Board was not sensitive enough to her predicaments and asked for too much in terms of a proof that the state was incapable to protect her: see, by analogy,\nN.K. v. Canada (Solicitor General)\n(1995), 107 F.T.R. 25 (F.C.); [1995] F.C.J. No. 889 (QL).\n\"With respect to an IFA, it is well established that 'the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists' (\nRasaratnam v. Canada (M.E.I.)\n, [1992] 1 F.C. 706, at p. 710; [1991] F.C.J. No. 1256 (QL).

Not only was this assumption disputed by the Applicant herself in her testimony before the Board (Transcripts, p. 38), but it defies logic to believe that an island separated only by a few kilometres of open water from Saint Vincent and easily accessible by ferry or plane could provide a safe heaven to the Applicant. The Board should have known that these islands are sparsely populated and geographically very small, and that it would be relatively easy to find somebody for whoever is bent on doing so. This information was readily accessible to the Board, as part of the Regional Country File that forms part of the record.

The knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity required to assess credibility in the present case\n\"As stated, knowing how to decide whether to believe a refugee claimant who has suffered domestic violence is critical. Under the heading 'D. Special Problems at Determination Hearings', the Gender Guidelines clearly point out that:\n'Women refugee claimants who have suffered sexual violence may exhibit a pattern of symptoms referred to as Rape Trauma Syndrome, and may require extremely sensitive handling. Similarly, women who have been subjected to domestic violence may exhibit a pattern of symptoms referred to as Battered Woman Syndrome and may also be reluctant to testify.'\n\"The 'pattern of symptoms' to be expected of women who have been battered is described in the footnote to the quote just cited as follows:\n'For a discussion of the battered woman syndrome see\nR. v. Lavallee\n, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852. [S.C.C.] In\nLavallee\n, Madame Justice Wilson addressed the mythology about domestic violence and phrased the myth as \"[e]ither she was not as badly beaten as she claims, or she would have left the man long ago. Or, if she was battered that severely, she must have stayed out of some masochistic enjoyment of it\". The Court further indicated that a manifestation of the victimization of battered women is a \"reluctance to disclose to others the fact or the extent of the beatings\". In\nLavallee\n, the Court indicated that expert evidence can assist in dispelling these myths and be used to explain why a woman would remain in a battering relationship.'\n\"Therefore, the Gender Guidelines suggest that to assess the actions of a woman subjected to domestic violence, special knowledge is an essential tool to use in reaching a fair and correct judgment.\"\nState Protection", "018": "[18]\nAs Justice Konrad W. von Finckenstein stated in\nFidan v.

According to the coordinator [of the SVGHRA], the police are doing 'their job' with regards to filing complaints of domestic violence and have responded adequately to the problem. In the past, women tended to abandon complaints of domestic violence against perpetrators. But this trend has shifted somewhat, and more and more women are willing to seek judicial redress, although many still refuse to pursue their case once they have been filed with the police.\n\"Since 1992, victims of domestic violence have had access to legal redress through the Family Court system. The Family Court provides judicial and counselling services free of charge. Victims can also seek assistance through the SVGHRA, Marion Hall, a non-governmental social services agency, and the government's Ministry of Social Services.\n. . . . .\n\"She [a counsellor and coordinator of the youth assistance program at Marion House] corroborated the information provided by the coordinator of the SVGHRA regarding shelters and legal aid clinics, but provided contrasting information regarding the police response to complaints of domestic violence by stating that they are 'very poor'. She added that many officers are 'unhelpful' in providing information to victims of domestic violence about their legal rights. According to the coordinator, most cases are not taken seriously and are met with indifference. The general attitude tends to marginalize the problem of domestic violence; moreover, given that the country is small, there is a feeling among victims that there is no protection available and that there is 'no place to go'.\n\"Few perpetrators of domestic violence are arrested, and when they are, they are soon after released. Many of the perpetrators are police officers themselves. Cases that make it to the judicial level are often thrown out either for lack of evidence or for technical reasons. Services for victims are 'minimal'. For those women seeking legal redress, Marion House can refer them to lawyers who provide services pro-bono.\"", "023": "[23]\nGiven this probative evidence, the Board was not justified to conclude on page 3 of the decision that Ms. Myle's story of a lack of interest from the police was not plausible as a whole, because it could reasonably be possible, as was shown in\nFranklyn v.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is the diagnostic category in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV classification system, which describes the development of characteristic symptoms following a psychologically disturbing event which is outside the range of usual human experience and which is usually experienced with marked fear, terror and helplessness.

She is able to hold in much of her emotional distress because of her need to be strong for her family, especially her oldest daughter.'\n\"I find that the CRDD made its decision without regard to the evidence just quoted, and therefore, respecting Rashmi's mother, father, and sibling, under s. 18.1(4)(d) of the\nFederal Court Act\n, I set the decision aside and refer their applications to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.

During the year, the police received 66 reports of rape. Of these, 22 cases were in court, 42 were under investigation, and 2 were dropped for lack of evidence. In 2003, women made over 1,000 reports of physical, sexual, emotional, and other domestic violence. The\nDomestic Violence/Matrimonial Proceedings Act\nprohibits domestic violence.

Development banks provided funding through the Caribbean Association for Family Research and Action for a program of Domestic Violence Prevention, Training, and Intervention.

In the minds of many, the belief still lingered that it was the right of the man to beat his spouse.

In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact.

In doing so, the Court stated:\n[19] I have reviewed the Board's decision and I have come to the conclusion that the Board did not make any finding with respect to whether the applicant was a member of the Falun Gong group. The Board did not believe the applicant's story with respect to her persecution in China but it did not address whether she was a member of the group.

The applicant can show that the fear the applicant has is based on the acts committed or likely to be committed against others who belong to the same group as does the applicant. There is evidence in the record that members of the Falun Gong group have been persecuted in China. The applicant's refugee claim could succeed based on her membership in the Falun Gong if the Board was to find that members of the Falun Gong group were or were likely to be persecuted. This is why it was so important to determine in clear language whether or not the applicant was a member of Falun Gong. The Board did not complete the analysis with respect to persecution due to the applicant's membership in Falun Gong as it did not determine whether or not she was a member of Falon [\nsic\n] Gong.

The applicant submits that on April 7, 2006, she was advised that two fellow practitioners had been arrested while distributing Falun Gong leaflets. As a result, the applicant immediately went into hiding at a relative's home. On April 9, 2006, while in hiding, the applicant learned that the PSB had been to her home on April 9, 2006, looking to arrest her for being involved in illegal Falun Gong activities.

Under s. 97, the Board, in this case, stated that it only need consider whether the IFA is: (i) reasonably accessible to the claimant; and (ii) not a locale where the claimant would face a serious possibility of risk to life, or risk of cruel or unusual punishment.

The Board stated that it preferred the documentary evidence that the police align themselves with whoever is in power, rather than the Applicant's evidence that many of the police in the districts are still working with AL goons. The Board stated that its reasons were that it \"prefers the documentary evidence as it comes from neutral sources with no interest in the outcome of these proceedings.\" From this, I conclude that the Board was aware of and dealt with the essence of the Applicant's claim.", "004": "[4]\nThe key decision of the Board was made with respect to the existence of an IFA.

As provided in the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in\nBaker\n, the best interests of the children is an important factor but not necessarily the governing factor.

Children's rights, and attention to their interests, are central humanitarian and compassionate values in Canadian society. Indications of children's interests as important considerations governing the manner in which H & C powers should be exercised may be found, for example, in the purposes of the\nAct\n, in international instruments, and in the guidelines for making H & C decisions published by the Minister herself.\"\nShe then continues and states at page 863 [S.C.R.]:\n\"The above factors indicate that emphasis on the rights, interests, and needs of children and special attention to childhood are important values that should be considered in reasonably interpreting the 'humanitarian' and 'compassionate' considerations that guide the exercise of discretion. I conclude that because the reasons for this decision do not indicate that it was made in a manner which was alive, attentive, or sensitive to the interests of Ms. Baker's children, and did not consider them as an important factor in making the decision, it was an unreasonable exercise of the power conferred by the legislation, and must, therefore, be overturned. In addition, the reasons for decision failed to give sufficient weight and consideration to the hardship that a return to Jamaica might cause Ms. Baker, given the fact that she had been in Canada for 12 years, was ill and might not be able to obtain treatment in Jamaica, and would necessarily be separated from at least some of her children.\n\"It follows that I disagree with the Federal Court of Appeal's holding in\nShah\n, supra, at p. 239, that a s. 114(2) decision is 'wholly a matter of judgment and discretion' ... While I agree with the Court of Appeal that the\nAct\ngives the applicant no right to a particular outcome or to the application of a particular legal test, and that the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not mandate a result consistent with the wording of any international instruments, the decision must be made following an approach that respects humanitarian and compassionate values. Therefore, attentiveness and sensitivity to the importance of the rights of children, to their best interests, and to the hardship that may be caused to them by a negative decision is essential for an H & C decision to be made in a reasonable manner. ...\n\"The principles discussed above indicate that, for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration.

At paragraph 55 Nadon, J., states:\n\"The first one, which I would characterize as the process approach, is the one taken in the\nYoung\n,\nMayburov\nand\nRussell\ndecisions. The other approach, which I would characterize as the substantive approach, is the one taken in the other cases. Under the process approach, the Court will examine whether the immigration officer has taken into consideration the effects which the parents' departure from Canada might have upon the children. If the immigration officer has taken into consideration these effects, the Court will not intervene, even though the decision made is not a favourable one to the applicant. On the other hand, under the substantive approach, the Court will not only verify whether the officer has considered the effects of a refusal of the parents' application under section 114(2), but will go further and assess whether the ultimate decision is the correct one.\"\nIn my view, I do not have to choose between these approaches in this case, since under either approach the failure of the Officer to take into account the children's inability to speak the Tamil language is an error. It is certainly something that should have been taken into account in considering the best interests of the children. The Immigration Officer looked at the risks to the children and, since their risk was the same as the parents' risk, concluded that there would be no risk to the children. However, an analysis of the best interests of the children requires an officer to look at more than just the risk to the children. The only analysis of the best interests of the children, and a very limited one at that, is included in paragraph 10 of the Officer's affidavit referred to above.

Also in the present case there are no consequences of any kind indicated in the Act or the Regulations which would flow from nonconformance with the provision regarding a hearing to be held at least thirteen weeks before the projected date of release nor is there anything to indicate that the stipulation would be mandatory. As there is no such indication, then one must consider the general object of the legislation. As to the general object of the Parole Act, it seems to be clear that the Act itself and, more particularly, the amendments introduced in 1986, which substituted a presumptive release date for mandatory release, was enacted not only for the purpose of benefitting the prisoners but also, and mainly for the protection of the public against the possible consequences of a release from parole, since the absolute right of the inmate for release on parole when a certain portion of the sentence served has been removed and release becomes subject to control by the Parole Board.", "008": "[8]\nCollier, J., of this Court approved and applied the above mentioned principle in the case of City of Melville v.

However, this is tempered, or qualified, by s. 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n, which requires that when new and credible evidence is presented during a reconsideration proceeding, the Board has a duty to consider and weigh the evidence, drawing every reasonable inference in the applicant's favour. This does not mean that the Board must automatically accept whatever submission is made by a veteran; rather, the evidence must be accepted if it is credible and reasonable, and uncontradicted.", "029": "[29]\nThe jurisprudence indicates that the Board must accept uncontradicted medical evidence that it considers credible in the circumstances; however, it may reject such evidence if it has before it contradictory evidence, or if it states reasons, which would bear on credibility and reasonableness:\nHornby, Re\n(1993), 63 F.T.R. 188 (T.D.);\nKing v. Veterans Review and Appeal Board (Can.)\n(1987), 138 F.T.R. 15 (T.D.); and\nMoar\n, supra.\nVIII. Conclusion", "023": "[23]\nBefore a veteran can be considered entitled to a pension, two conditions must be satisfied. First, the veteran's condition must be pensionable; it must be a condition capable of being classified as a disability resulting from injury or disease. Second, the original condition must arise from, or be aggravated by, the veteran's military service. Thus, causation must be established, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption found in s. 21(3) of the\nPension Act\nallows for causation to be presumed if the injury was incurred during the course of the veteran's service. In\nHall\n, supra, Madame Justice Reed stated:\n\"While the applicant correctly asserts that uncontradicted evidence by him should be accepted unless a lack of credibility finding is made, and that every reasonable inference should be drawn, and any reasonable doubt resolved in his favour, he still has the obligation to demonstrate that the medical difficulty from which he now suffers arose out of or in connection with his military service; that is, the causal linkage must be established.\"", "014": "[14]\nThe Board specifically acknowledged documentation submitted by the applicant as new evidence in support of his application for reconsideration. This new evidence was comprised of: a statement by Robert Stratton, dated 25 March 1997 attesting to the 1963 truck accident; copies of x-ray reports dated 18 December 1970, 10 November 1971, 29 December 1971, 13 January 1972, 11 February 1972, 20 June 1972, and 26 June 1973; a statement by Carl Purcell, dated 18 June 1997, advising that he trained with the applicant in the early 1960s in running; a note from Brenda Morris of Stora Industries, dated 27 May 1997, with attached copies of Worker's Compensation Board forms indicating that the applicant pulled back muscles in December 1971; and a letter from the applicant dated 16 July 1997 (AR, tab 5, pp. 30-39).\nIV. Applicant's Position", "005": "[5]\nThe applicant filed an application for pension entitlement on 24 March 1995. Entitlement was denied in a Minister's decision from Veterans Affairs Canada, dated 9 April 1996. This decision was confirmed by the Entitlement Review Panel in a decision dated 15 July 1996. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board affirmed that decision on 27 March 1997. The applicant submitted an application for reconsideration of this decision, and it is of this negative determination that the applicant now seeks judicial review.\nII. Legislative Framework", "026": "[26]\nThe gist of the x-ray reports, according to the applicant, is that they provide medical evidence detailing a spinal injury which could only have been caused by the 1963 accident. The applicant alleges the Board fell into error in failing to accept this medical evidence, and relies on\nMacKay v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1997), 129 F.T.R. 286 (T.D.), which is somewhat similar to the present case.", "021": "[21]\nOn an application for judicial review, the court may not substitute its decision for that made by the board or tribunal which is under review. In light of the legislative framework which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, as well as the privative clause which renders its decisions final and binding, the applicable standard of review is that of patent unreasonableness:\nWeare v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1998), 153 F.T.R. 75 (T.D.). Thus, the reviewing court may interfere only in the event that the impugned decision was based on an error of law, or on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it:\nHall v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1998), 152 F.T.R. 58 (T.D.).", "017": "[17]\nThe respondent argues that the applicant has an obligation to adduce evidence establishing a causal link between service in the Forces and the present disability, and that he failed to satisfy this obligation. The first medical evidence regarding back pain, the respondent contends, occurred in March 1993. This evidence did not lead the Board to conclude that the applicant's current back problem originated during his service because nothing in the reports attribute his lumbar disc disease to an injury such as the one the applicant claims to have occurred in 1963. The respondent submits that the Board's decision is supportable as there was no credible evidence tendered by the applicant establishing causation.\nVI. Issues", "015": "[15]\nThe applicant submits that the Board erred in law by disregarding evidence, and further, that it violated the principles of natural justice and fairness by ignoring evidence of his injury. The applicant argues that the Board erred in failing to accept medical evidence that was not contradicted by other evidence or subject to an adverse credibility finding, relying on\nMoar v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.) in support of this submission.", "010": "[10]\nSections 3 and 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\ngovern the conduct of applications for pension benefits:\n\"3. The provisions of this Act and of any other Act of Parliament or of any regulations made under this or any other Act of Parliament conferring or imposing jurisdiction, powers, duties or functions on the Board shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled.\n. . . . .\n\"39. In all proceedings under this Act, the Board shall\n(a) draw from all the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant or appellant;\n(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances; and\n(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case.\"", "008": "[8]\nThus, if a veteran suffers a disability resulting from an injury or disease that arose out of or was directly connected with military service in peace time, a pension may be granted. Furthermore, if the initial injury or disease did not result in a disability, but rather resulted in a condition which then led to a disability, a pension may still be granted.", "013": "[13]\nThe applicant was informed by letter dated 15 January 1998 of the Board's decision, which had been rendered on 1 October 1997 (AR, tab 2). The decision affirmed the Entitlement Appeal Panel's decision of 27 March 1997. In its decision, the Board held,\n\"The Board has carefully reviewed all of the available evidence in this case and has concluded, in the absence of a Report on Injuries to document the incident which allegedly took place in 1963, and confirming whether or not the appellant was on duty at that time, that the condition of lumbar disc disease is not related to the exigencies of peace time service. Furthermore, service records are devoid of any complaints regarding the appellant's back. The first medical evidence regarding back problems appears in a report dated 22 March 1993 from D.J. O'Neil, M.D., indicating a long history of low back pain, this published some 29 years after the appellant was released from service.\n\"It is further noted that the appellant injured his back in 1971, 1972 and 1990, again several years in the post-discharge period, and while the appellant maintains that his back problems pre-dated his 1971 injury, that is, his back problems arose from the alleged incident at the Bedford Rifle Range in 1963, without any recorded in-service evidence the Board is unable to grant pension entitlement. Moreover, the Board was not presented with any new medical evidence that would lead it to the conclusion that the appellant's present day had its onset during peace time service.\"", "006": "[6]\nIn 1995, Parliament created the Veterans Review and Appeal Board when it enacted the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n, S.C. 1995, c. 18. The Board functions as the sole review and appeal authority for veterans' pensions, replacing the Veterans Appeal Board, the Pension Review Board, and the War Veterans Allowance Board.", "020": "[20]\nWith respect, I consider the sole issue in this case to be whether the Board's weighing of the evidence that was before it was patently unreasonable, with regard to the Board's statutory obligations found in ss. 3 and 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n.\nVII. Analysis", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant, Anthony Douglas MacDonald, was born in 1946. He enlisted with the Canadian Armed Forces and served in the Militia from 26 July 1963 until 27 January 1964, and in the Regular Forces from 4 August 1967 until 11 August 1967. In September 1963, the applicant claims he was riding in the back of a truck with other members of his unit, in the course of their duties, when the truck had an accident. The applicant claims he was injured, received treatment on site in a mobile hospital unit, and returned to his duties shortly thereafter. The accident and injury, however, are not recorded in the applicant's service medical records (application record (\"AR\"), tab 6, affidavit of Bunty Albert, exhibit A).", "011": "[11]\nThe\nAct\ncontains a privative clause in s. 31, as well as a provision in s. 32 allowing for reconsideration of an application already heard:\n\"31.

The provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to provide compensation to those members of the forces who have been disabled or have died as a result of military service, and to their dependants, may be fulfilled.\"", "012": "[12]\nIn further assistance to applicants, the\nPension Act\ncreates favourable presumptions; the relevant one for the purposes of the case at bar is contained in s. 21(3):\n\"21(3) For the purposes of subs. (2), an injury or disease, or the aggravation of an injury or disease, shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service of the kind described in that subsection if the injury or disease or the aggravation thereof was incurred in the course of\n. . . . .\n(f) any military operation, training or administration, either as a result of a specific order or established military custom or practice, whether or not failure to perform the act that resulted in the disease or injury or aggravation thereof would have resulted in disciplinary action against the member.\"\nThus, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, causation is presumed if the injury was incurred during the course of the applicant's service.\nIII. Board's Decision", "028": "[28]\nThis case, however, is distinguishable from the applicant's case because in\nMacKay\n, the applicant veteran's accident and injury were documented at the time they occurred. In the present case, the Board does not accept the applicant's claim that he was ever involved in an accident, let alone injured, while on duty because nothing exists in the applicant's service records indicating he was in an accident and injured. In its reasons, the Board comes close to saying that a veteran is not entitled to a disability pension in the absence of an injury report in his service records.", "030": "[30]\nThe Board erred in failing to either accept the new evidence presented to it, or reject it with reasons bearing on its credibility and reasonableness. Accordingly, the application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is sent back to heard anew.\nApplication allowed.", "004": "[4]\nIn 1970 and 1971, the applicant experienced musculature injuries to his back. As a result of the 1971 injury, tests revealed an old injury to his spine. A 1972 car accident\nresulted in injuries to his leg and skull, but not his back. In 1990, the applicant re-aggravated the original injury by moving a large rock, or boulder (AR, tab 5, page 43).", "025": "[25]\nWhile the Board acknowledged this new evidence and admitted it into the record, it cannot be said to have accepted it in accordance with the special rules contained in s. 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n. In its reasons, the Board characterizes the truck accident as an \"alleged incident\", thus indicating doubt of its actual occurrence. In so doing, however, the Board was silent as to whether this new evidence, which purports to corroborate the applicant's claim that he was injured in 1963, was credible or reasonable. If the Board found this evidence lacking in either capacity, it should have said so and given reasons. While the Board is certainly entitled to assign minimal weight to this evidence, it must articulate reasons for so doing. Failing to do so constitutes an error in law and warrants judicial intervention.", "001": "[1]\nCullen, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (the \"Board\") dated 1 October 1997, of which the applicant received notice on 15 January 1998, affirming the decision of the Entitlement Appeal Panel denying the applicant benefits under the\nPension Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c.

(See Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/98-166,\nCanada Gazette Part II\n, vol. 132, No. 7 at pp. 1057-1058). One of the changes specifically referred to in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement as constituting a mechanism for reducing unnecessary litigation was the enactment of the provision, in s. 6(7)(a), permitting the court to order disclosure of any portion of the submission for a notice of compliance, if relevant to the disposition of the issues in the proceeding. A review of the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement therefore confirms unequivocally that, in enacting s. 6(7)(a), Parliament intended to reduce and streamline litigation. However, there is no specific evidence in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement or otherwise concerning the legislative intent underlying the enactment of s. 6(7)(b).", "022": "[22]\nAs the second branch of his argument, counsel for the Minister submitted that, prior to making an order for verification under s. 6(7)(b), the applicant should be required to establish that material differences may exist between the information produced and the information filed with the Minister. I cannot accept that submission on the basis that s. 6(7) contains no such test, and I see no reason to read those words into the legislation. Furthermore, the position advanced by the Minister is completely inconsistent with the underlying legislative intention in s. 6(7) to reduce unnecessary litigation. Indeed, the interpretation urged by the Minister would have the undesirable effect of requiring an applicant to establish on a motion that material differences may exist between the information produced and the information in the submission for a notice of compliance. In litigating that issue, affidavits would be filed, cross-examinations would be conducted, other motions would perhaps be brought concerning refusals on cross-examination and a hearing would be held. In other words, the parties would be required to engage in time-consuming litigation for the sole purpose of ensuring that the court has the proper material before it to dispose of the substantive questions raised in the proceeding. The interpretation proposed by the Minister simply cannot be consistent with the legislative intention of reducing litigation. It is also not consistent with the express wording of s. 6(7), when considered in its entire context.", "023": "[23]\nThe motion is granted with costs. Apotex shall produce all relevant portions of its submissions for a notice of compliance describing the process for the preparation of its drug paroxetine hydrochloride. The Minister shall verify that any portion of the submission for a notice of compliance produced corresponds fully to the information in the submission filed with him.\nMotion granted.", "014": "[14]\nIn interpreting s. 6(7), reference must therefore be made briefly to the legislative scheme in the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, its purpose and the intention of Parliament.", "005": "[5]\nIn support of its motion, SmithKline adduced affidavit evidence from an expert in chemistry, Dr. Alexander Fallis, a professor of chemistry at the University of Ottawa. In his affidavit, Dr. Fallis stated, among other things, that Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,038,390 (\"'390 patent\") contains a generic claim covering a large number of compounds, including paroxetine hydro\u00adchloride, but that it \"... does not spe\u00adcifi\u00adcally disclose the existence of paroxetine, let alone paroxetine hydrochloride, let alone a par\u00adticular polymorphic form of paroxetine hydrochloride\". As a result, the allegation that Apotex would only use paroxetine hydrochloride in the form disclosed and claimed in the '390 patent revealed \"nothing\" to Dr. Fallis about the form of paroxetine hydrochloride made by Apotex, \"... as there is no form of paroxetine hydrochloride dis\u00adclosed in the '390 patent\". Dr. Fallis also examined a synthetic scheme outlined in the portion of the drug master file disclosed to SmithKline, together with the disclosed portions of the abbreviated new drug sub\u00admission and the teachings in Canadian Let\u00adters Patent No. 2,210,023 (\"'023 patent\"). In short, he concluded that there must be fur\u00adther processing steps after the re-crystalli\u00adzation step in the synthetic scheme included in the materials provided to SmithKline. In order to determine the question of infringe\u00adment of the '023 patent, Dr. Fallis was of the opinion that it would be \"important to know\" what further processing was done by Apotex after the re-crystallization step in the synthetic scheme outlined in the disclosed portion of the drug master file.", "021": "[21]\nIn considering the first submission advanced by the Minister, namely that s. 6(7)(b) is an \"additional or supplementary remedy\" that should not \"necessarily\" be made following the making of an order for production under s. 6(7)(a), it is significant to note that, prior to the enactment of s. 6(7), the court consistently ordered the Minister, and not the second person (in most cases the generic manufacturer), to produce the confidential information. In those circumstances, there was obviously never any concern in relation to the accuracy, the completeness or the currency of the information produced, given the Minister's neutral position in such matters. However, s. 6(7)(a) empowers the court to order the second person, and not the Minister, to produce the relevant portions of the confidential information filed in the submission for a notice of compliance. In the circumstances, the provision in s. 6(7)(b) was clearly intended to operate as an administrative check, designed to eliminate any questions being raised concerning the information produced, including matters such as its accuracy, completeness and currency. As such, s. 6(7)(b) was not intended to be read in isolation as an \"additional or supplementary remedy\", but rather was intended to constitute an integral part of every order made by the court concerning the production of confidential information. In other words, s. 6(7)(b) should not be construed as a discrete power separate from s. 6(7)(a). Indeed, when considered in its context, the sole legislative purpose of s. 6(7)(b) is to reduce unnecessary litigation by eliminating any uncertainty concerning the information produced. As such, both constituent parts of s. 6(7) are intended to reduce unnecessary litigation. Finally, the legislative amendment relieves the Minister of the more onerous burden of actually producing the information, as he was required to do under the previous jurisprudence, and replaces it with the straightforward and simple administrative task of verifying that the information produced corresponds with the information filed. That seems to be a relatively small price to pay for injecting certainty into the process, thereby reducing unnecessary litigation.", "017": "[17]\nIn order to determine the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 6(7) of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, assistance may be obtained by examining the circumstances leading to its enactment, as well as the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement prepared as part of the regulatory process. A Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, which accompanies but does not form part of the\nRegulations\n, reveals the intentions of the government and contains \"... information as to the purpose and effect of the proposed regulation\".

Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare)\n(1997), 75 C.P.R.(3d) 129 (F.C.T.D.), at pp. 131-32:\n'A NOC, which formally authorizes a drug to be sold, is issued by the Minister after a drug manufacturer has complied on two fronts. The first element of compliance concerns the overall safety and efficacy of the drug: (see regulation C.08.004 of the\nFood and Drug Regulations\n, C.R.C. 1978, c. 870). The second element of compliance figures on the drug manufacturer's non-infringement of certain patents embodied in the drug. This second, rather more unexpected, patent-related requirement came into existence after changes to the compulsory licensing regime. Formerly, under a compulsory license, a generic drug manufacturer could obtain a licensed supply of a patented drug from the patent owner. The NOC process did not then concern itself with questions of patent infringement. However, with the abolition of compulsory licenses under the\nPatent Act Amendment Act, 1992\n, ... (the \"\nPatent Act\n\") the regime for obtaining NOCs also changed. Generic drug manufacturers now seeking NOCs must file what is called a Notice of Allegation under section 5 of the\nRegulations\n.\n. . . . .\n'In effect, under section 5(3) of the\nRegulations\n, in a \"Notice of Allegation\", the generic drug manufacturer, \"the second person\", signals its compliance with the patents embodied in a medicine. Under section 4 of the\nRegulations\n, the patent owner or licensee, usually a brand name drug manufacturer like the applicants, submits a list of the patents that contain claims for the medicine itself or the use of the medicine.

I also note that the evidence of Dr. Fallis that it would be \"important\", in determining the question of infringement, to assess the fur\u00adther processing done by Apotex after the re-crystallization step revealed in the disclosed materials was not undermined in cross-exam\u00adination. Apotex shall therefore produce to SmithKline pp. 6 to 19 of the drug master file of its wholly owned subsidiary Brantford Chemicals.

Although some form of paroxetine hydrochloride could therefore be made using claim 1 of the '390 patent, he did not know what form would result, given that the '390 patent gives \"no indication of form\" and no discrete recipe for paroxetine hydrochloride. In contrast, the '023 patent \"... is specifically directed to various forms ...\" of paroxetine hydrochloride, and the product can be tailored to one form or another. Although the form of paroxetine hydrochloride made under claim 1 of the '390 patent could not be predicted ahead of time, various means exist for analyzing a compound to determine its form, including X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and examining melting points.", "020": "[20]\nHaving placed s. 6(7) of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\nin its proper legislative context, the interpretation urged by the Minister must now be considered.

In that decision, Iacobucci, J., writing for the court, outlined the following framework for statutory interpretation, at pp. 40-41 [S.C.R.]:\n\"At the heart of this conflict is an issue of statutory interpretation. Consistent with the findings of the Court of Appeal, the plain meaning of the words of the provisions here in question appears to restrict the obligation to pay termination and severance pay to those employers who have actively terminated the employment of their employees. At first blush, bankruptcy does not fit comfortably into this interpretation. However, with respect, I believe this analysis is incomplete.\n\"Although much has been written about the interpretation of legislation (see, e.g. Ruth Sullivan,\nStatutory Interpretation (1997)\n; Ruth Sullivan,\nDriedger on the Construction of Statutes\n(3rd Ed. 1994) (hereinafter '\nConstruction of Statutes\n'); Pierre-Andr\u00e9 C\u00f4t\u00e9, the\nInterpretation of Legislation in Canada\n(2nd Ed. 1991)), Elmer Driedger in\nConstruction of Statutes\n(2nd Ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87 he states:\n'Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.'\n\"Recent cases which have cited the above passage with approval include:\nR. v.

In addition, it is argued that the grounds do not fall within the limited circumstances in which this court can reconsider the terms of its own orders. Rule 337(5) provides a mechanism for the court to reconsider orders made where the court commits an oversight. Rule 337(5) does not allow the court to reexamine the conclusions which it has drawn from the evidence:\nKeleher et al. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans)\n(1989), 26 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.). The present case is not a case in which some matter should have been dealt with was accidentally overlooked or omitted. Counsel for the respondent also argues:\n\"The respondent also takes the position that, on the merits, this is not an appropriate case for reconsideration. Madame Justice Reed, in the order in question, stated that the personal schedule of counsel is not sufficient reason for an extension to be granted. There was material before the court that the reason the extension was sought was counsel's attendance at the Canadian Bar Association convention. Clearly, this was a professional matter, and not merely a personal commitment. However, the scheduling difficulties which resulted for counsel are personal to counsel. The respondent submits that conflicts between client deadlines and nonclient professional commitments, including attendance at Bar Conventions (whether as a member of Provincial Council or as a member at large) and attendance at Continuing Legal Education seminars for five days out of a 30 day time limit are not sufficient reasons to warrant the court granting an extension of time.\"", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant had filed, on July 28, 1993, an application for leave and, if leave was granted, for judicial review of a decision of an immigration officer which decision had refused to allow him to make an inland application for landing.

Firstly there was no oversight on my part respecting the evidence before me. I knew that counsel would be attending the Bar Convention. I also determined that she was in control of the scheduling of the preparation of the application record and knew of the Bar Convention commitment well in advance of its occurrence. I thus could not justify granting an extension of time on the basis of the material filed. I did not know that counsel was attending the Bar Convention as a member of Provincial Council, rather than merely as a member at large. I cannot honestly say at this time whether if I had known that fact it would have affected my decision. It certainly does not make counsel's absence from town any more unanticipated. It does add an element of constraint on her ability to change her plans. The capacity in which she was attending the convention was however known at the time the application for an extension of time was filed. It is not information which has recently come to light. I am not convinced that circumstances exist which allow a reconsideration of my order.", "009": "[9]\nThere was no such unanticipated cause for the delay in the present case. At the time the leave application was filed, it was known that the time limit for the filing of the application was 30 days, counsel knew her client lived in Campbell River and that she would be attending the Bar Convention towards the end of August. The scheduling was under her personal control.

With respect to this last there was really no evidence filed to support that claim.

If they are too short then requests should be made to have the\nRules\namended so that the time limits are lengthened. I do not grant requests for extensions of time merely because it is the first time that counsel has asked or because the work load which counsel has assumed is too great. I think such decisions are unfair to those counsel who refuse clients because their work load is too heavy to allow them to meet required deadlines or who \"pull out all the stops\" to meet the deadlines, at great inconvenience to themselves. As I have indicated I take the view that the time limits set out in the\nRules\nare meant to be complied with and they are meant to apply to everyone equally. If an automatic extension was meant to be available merely because counsel seeks one, then, the\nRules\nshould provide for such an automatic extension, for everyone, when such is sought."}, "decision": "counsel's workload is not a reason justifying granting an extension of time"}, "524": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nAs noted above, I am satisfied that the Defendants have infringed the LV Trade-marks on at least six occasions since March 17, 2006. The Plaintiffs are entitled to an award in damages or profits in respect of the infringing activities (\nTrade-marks Act\n, s. 53.2). The only question remaining is to assess the amount of either damages or profits.", "033": "[33]\nThe actual profits are not capable of definitive proof due to the failure of the Defendants to defend the claim. Thus, all of the calculations must be based on the best available evidence, reasonable inferences, the Plaintiffs' experiences in similar situations and a dose of common sense.", "046": "[46]\nThe leading case on punitive damages is the Supreme Court decision in\nWhiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.\n, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595. As stated by Justice Binnie, punitive damages will be awarded against a defendant:\n... in exceptional cases for \"malicious, oppressive and high-handed\" misconduct that \"offends the court's sense of decency\":\nHill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto\n, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at para. 196. The test thus limits the award to misconduct that represents a marked departure from ordinary standards of decent behaviour. Because their objective is to punish the defendant rather than compensate a plaintiff (whose just compensation will already have been assessed), punitive damages straddle the frontier between civil law (compensation) and criminal law (punishment) (\nWhitten,\nabove at para. 36)", "050": "[50]\nWhat would be an appropriate quantum of punitive damages in this case? The Plaintiffs have asked for punitive damages of $100,000. In\nWhiten\n, above, at para.111, Justice Binnie held that a proper award of punitive damages must be proportionate to the end sought to be achieved and set out a number of applicable principles. I have considered these principles in considering the question of quantum of punitive damages", "037": "[37]\nWith respect to estimates of the costs of these goods, the affidavit of the Senior Anticounterfeiting Manager for North America of Louis Vuitton was very comprehensive and persuasive. Using her calculations, I would agree that a cost to the Defendants would likely be no more than $18 per item. Thus, the Plaintiffs' estimate of $31,186 for profits for goods delivered up in March 2006 and March 2007 events is reasonable. This amount is calculated by subtracting the costs per item seized from the sale value of items seized.", "058": "[58]\nAlso, it is evident from the record that the Defendants' behaviour in trying to avoid service and failing to defend the action has caused the Plaintiffs to incur unnecessary legal fees and disbursements.", "052": "[52]\nFinally, I observe that an award of $100,000 is well within the range awarded in the post-\nWhiten\ncases of\nEvocation Publishing Corp. v.

(4th) 52 (B.C.S.C.) and\nMicrosoft Corp 1\n.", "041": "[41]\nThe only evidence that is helpful in this difficult job is the evidence from the investigators that, on at least three of the other occasions when they attended at K2 Fashions, other accessories bearing the LV Trade-mark were seen. Thus, I am prepared to conclude, applying some logic to the situation, that the goods that were seen in the store or were likely present or available for purchase were, in fact, sold. A conservative estimate of profits for the items available for sale on those occasions is, in my view, roughly $15,000 per incident - for a total of $45,000.", "031": "[31]\nThe second aspect of damages would be the sales that the Defendants have made that would have been made by the Plaintiffs. Given the nature of this counterfeit business, it is simply not reasonable to assume that someone who buys an LV \"knock-off\" from K2 Fashions would otherwise have bought a product with the genuine LV Trade-mark. I would think it reasonable to assume that a person buying one the counterfeit LV products would be motivated almost exclusively by price and would not likely pay the full price of the genuine article.", "018": "[18]\nAs permitted by s. 38.1 of the\nCopyright Act\n, the Plaintiffs have elected an award of statutory damages. Pursuant to s. 38.1(1) of the\nCopyright Act\n, the Plaintiffs, as the Copyright owners, may elect an award of statutory damages \"in a sum of not less than $500 or more than $20,000 as the court considers just\".", "040": "[40]\nThe next difficulty that I have with the Plaintiffs' submissions is their assumption that the Defendants turn over their stock of counterfeit LV inventory at least four to six times per year. I have carefully reviewed the affidavits on this point and cannot identify any evidence that would support such a statement. While I am prepared to assume that the goods seized or delivered up would, at some point, have been sold, I am not persuaded that I ought to make an assumption that the same volume of counterfeit goods would be sold some four to six times per year.", "045": "[45]\nI turn then to consider whether, on the facts of this case, exemplary or punitive damages should be awarded. I note first that there is no statutory impediment to assessing punitive damages in addition to profits or damages calculated in the usual manner. With respect to the Copyrighted Works, the Court's ability to award punitive damages in addition to an election to statutory damages is enshrined in s. 38.1(7) of the\nCopyright Act\n.

The evidence noted earlier in these reasons demonstrating that the Defendants have knowingly and intentionally infringed the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights over a long period of time is relevant to this issue.\nIn addition to that conduct, further examples were provided by the Plaintiffs:\n\u2022 When approached by the Plaintiffs' hired investigator on May 23, 2007, the Defendant Pi-Chu Lin stated she did not speak English, stated that her name was \"Coco\" and locked the K2 Fashions store rather than cooperate.\n\u2022 The Defendant Pi-Chu Lin ran from K2 Fashions when the Plaintiffs attempted to serve her on July 9, 2007. Ms. Lin and other employees at K2 Fashions stated they could not speak English when confronted by a private investigator hired by the Plaintiffs.\n\u2022 The Defendant, Mr. Yang, stated on April 4, 2006 that he would leave the country if the Plaintiffs pursued him. On May 2007 the Plaintiffs telephoned Mr. Yang who advised he was in Taiwan.", "023": "[23]\nThe first factor to consider is the good or bad faith of the Defendants. The second factor is the conduct of the Defendants. In this case, these factors are linked. I refer to the following:\n1. The Defendants have been aware since December 2001, when an Anton Piller Order was executed, that the sale of the counterfeit products was in violation of the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, they have persisted in selling infringing products.\n2. The Plaintiffs have obtained two previous judgments, the first on April 26, 2002, the second on June 8, 2004, restraining the sale of infringing products in the K2 Fashions store. The infringing activity has continued.\n3. The Defendants have been advised numerous times to stop the sale of products infringing on the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights since the June 8, 2004 judgment, but have nevertheless persisted in their infringing activities.\n4. The Defendants have attempted to conceal and cover-up their actions by placing the counterfeit products in hidden displays and drawers.", "014": "[14]\nAs noted, Mr. Yang was not personally served with the Statement of Claim. Since he was served substitutionally, I must be satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that it would be just to order default judgment (Rule 211,\nFederal Courts Rules\n). Mr. Yang's connection to both Ms. Lin and to K2 Fashions is evident from the affidavits filed in support of this motion. His role in the continuing sale of the Louis Vuitton counterfeit goods is apparent. It is, in my view, inconceivable that Mr. Yang is not aware of this action by the Plaintiffs. It would be just to order default judgment against Mr. Yang.", "044": "[44]\nThe amount of $87,000 is, in my view, justifiable on either the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs and on the use of the \"nominal\" damages approach. With either approach, I am hampered by the conduct of the Defendants who have refused to come forward to determine a more accurate assessment of damages. While it appears that the Plaintiffs are suffering in the award of damages through no fault of their own, I believe that punitive damages may be helpful in leveling the playing field and resulting in a total award that is just.\n5.3 Exemplary or Punitive Damages", "005": "[5]\nI direct my mind, first, to the question of service.

For Mr. Yang, substitutional service was approved by an Order of Prothonotary Lafr\u00e8niere, dated August 13, 2007.", "026": "[26]\nIn sum, I am satisfied that the maximum award of statutory damages in the amount of $20,000 for each of the two Copyright Works is appropriate.

Justice Harrington awarded the plaintiff $20,000 for each of the 25 copyrighted works which had been infringed after concluding that: (i) the defendants had not shown that that they had reasonable grounds to believe they had not infringed copyright; (ii) the minimum amount of $500 for each of the infringed works would be grossly out of proportion to the plaintiff; (iii) the defendants had demonstrated bad faith based on their general dismissive attitude to the Court; (iv) the defendants had failed to provide appropriate records, despite a court order; and (v) deterrence was necessary to prevent other infringements of the works in question (\nMicrosoft Corp 1,\nabove at paras. 106-115).", "032": "[32]\nAccordingly, I am unable, on the record before me, to quantify the damages suffered by the Plaintiffs.

On June 8, 2004, this Court granted judgment to the Plaintiffs and awarded injunctive relief and damages in respect of the infringements up to that date. Admittedly, the Defendants have ignored the Order, have continued to infringe and have failed to pay the amounts awarded. The Plaintiffs may have had recourse to the Court to enforce the earlier judgment. However, failure to comply with earlier injunctions and awards of damages does not permit the Plaintiffs to bring forward amounts of alleged profits from before the earlier judgment. On the other hand, the Defendants' conduct is certainly something to consider in assessing the appropriateness of punitive damages; that is considered later in these reasons. The evidence before me in this action can only establish that the infringing activities commenced on March 17, 2006; an accounting of profits can only begin from that date. The period of infringement is, therefore, approximately 18 months or 1.5 years. Based on the Plaintiffs' calculations on an annual basis, that would reduce the total profits claimed to a range of $90,000 to $135,000.", "056": "[56]\nJustice Harrington defined \"reprehensible\", \"scandalous\" and \"outrageous\" conduct in\nMicrosoft Corp. v. 9038-3746 Quebec Inc.,\n2007 FC 659 at para. 16 [\nMicrosoft Corp 2\n] as follows:\n\"Reprehensible\" behaviour is that deserving of censure or rebuke; blameworthy. \"Scandalous\" comes from scandal which may describe a person, thing, event or circumstance causing general public outrage or indignation.

In this case, that calculation would result in an award of $72,000 (at $6000 per infringing activity for each Plaintiff). The $6000 was first set in 1997 to represent a fair approximation of damages (\nNike Canada Ltd. v. Goldstar Design Ltd. et al.\n, T-1951-95 (F.C.T.D.)). The Plaintiffs have presented evidence to demonstrate that the $6000 scale amount, when adjusted for inflation, would now be approximately $7250.

The totals are calculated by determining an approximate average profit for the two batches of inventory delivered up (roughly $15,000) and assuming that this amount would be realized in profits at least four - and up to six - times per year.", "009": "[9]\nAlthough the evidence suggests that the sale of the counterfeit items has been continuous since the date of the last judgment of this Court involving the same store and subject matter (June 8, 2004, Court File T-209-04), there have been six distinct incidents after that date that are of direct relevance to this action.\n1. On March 17, 2006, an investigator attended at the K2 Fashions store, personally served Mr. Yang with a cease and desist letter and asked him to deliver up all inventory that bore the LV Trade-marks. Mr. Yang delivered up 130 items, including purses, wallets and jewellery, bearing the counterfeit LV Trade-marks or counterfeit copies of the Copyrighted Works.\n2. On June 28, 2006, an investigator acting on behalf of Louis Vuitton purchased a counterfeit necklace bearing a LV Trade-mark.\n3.

On March 12, 2007, an investigator served another cease and desist letter on a clerk at the store and asked the clerk to deliver up all Louis Vuitton inventory. The clerk delivered up 239 items including purses, wallets, key chains and jewellery, bearing the counterfeit Louis Vuitton Trade-marks or counterfeit copies of the Copyrighted Works, along with catalogues offering for sale unauthorized LV items.\n5. On May 23, 2007, the investigator again attended at the K2 store and observed more than 50 items bearing LV Trade-marks.

There are two aspects of damages in this situation. The first is the depreciation of goodwill (which, indirectly, results in loss of sales of legitimate LV merchandise) and the second is the direct loss of sales. While it is self-evident (at least to any person who is interested in high-fashion accessories) that the sale of counterfeit LV goods results in a depreciation of the goodwill attaching to the LV Trade-marks, quantification of the amount of such depreciation - if at all possible - would require a much more complete record.", "060": "[60]\nAs to the amount of such solicitor-client costs, I am satisfied that a lump sum award is warranted.

I accept these numbers. I also accept that, adding in conservative approximate values to the goods without price tags, the total sale value of the 130 counterfeit items delivered up on March 17, 2006 would have been approximately $14,000. The Plaintiffs carried out similar calculations for the 193 saleable items delivered up on March 12, 2007.

The LV products that are the subject of copyright protection are highly-valued by consumers. Being seen with one of the Plaintiffs' Copyrighted Works is a statement that carries significant societal weight in some sectors of the population. However, the continuing infringement of this and similar high-fashion accessories with similar copyright protection erodes the position that legitimate copyrighted products hold in the marketplace. Why would a person buy the Plaintiffs' Copyrighted Works when \"knock-offs\" can be sold and bought with few negative consequences? More seriously, why buy the legitimate product when others seeing it will assume that it is not likely a \"real\" LV Copyrighted Work? Although, to many, this aspect of the infringement is not serious, the erosion of the market for which the Plaintiffs have worked very hard is a serious consequence of the continuing behaviour of the Defendants and others who may also be infringing the Copyrighted Works.

But it is all hearsay and innuendo. What is more, the suggestions contained in this evidence are obviously not consistent with facts that are clearly established. For example, not everyone who participated in the Referendum Vote voted in favour of the new regime. The \"yes\" vote of 113 was 83% of the 136 votes cast. The number of eligible voters was approximately 267. The Respondents organized a petition of 113 votes which they say comes from people who want to continue with the traditional custom of voting. No evidence is provided as to how many of these people voted in the referendum, but the Respondents and their group have been very careful to boycott the whole referendum process in order to deny it legitimacy, so that it is reasonable to suppose that a good number of the petition signers did not participate in the Referendum Vote. All in all, it seems that a significant proportion of eligible voters at Nekaneet have, in one way or another, if the Respondents' own evidence is accepted, participated in recording their views on the governance debate, even though there is no evidence that gives the petition figure a legitimacy as a free vote.", "050": "[50]\nThere is no way that the Court can identify, parse and discuss every problem in the evidence and get this decision out in a timely way.

What is more, there is a taint of self-interest and conflict in the Respondents' evidence that cannot be left out of account. The Respondents are obviously wedded to the status quo and have vehemently resisted having governance issues decided by the Nekaneet First Nation as a whole. The Applicants, on the other hand, obviously wish to assume power, but they want to do so under a new system of governance that brings no obvious personal benefit to them and that is an attempt to introduce accountability and transparency to Nekaneet so that dysfunction, self-interest and nepotism can become a thing of the past.

Marie et al.\n(2003), 312 N.R. 385; 2003 FCA 385, the Federal Court of Appeal set out what should happen in cases such as the present where, strictly speaking, a decision of a band council is not being challenged but where the application seeks to challenge the right of a public office holder to hold office:\n\"18. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the\nFederal Court Act\n, the Federal Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of quo warranto or to grant declaratory relief. I see no reason why declaratory relief which, in substance, is in the nature of quo warranto, cannot be granted. That procedure appears to have been approved in\nLake Babine Indian Band et al. v. Williams et al.\n(1996), 194 N.R. 44 (F.C.A.). Robertson, J.A., states at paragraphs 3 and 4:\n'3. It is to be noted at the outset that the appellants do not dispute the jurisdiction of the court to address the issues herein. The respondents seek declaratory and injunctive relief, which in these circumstances essentially amounts to a request for a writ of quo warranto. Quo warranto allows a challenge of an individual's right to hold a particular office ...\n'4. There is no doubt therefore that there is jurisdiction per se, an Indian Band Council being a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\" within the meaning of ss. 2 and 18 of the\nAct\n. ... Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to address the issue but it can do so only in the context of a s. 18 application not in the context of an action initiated by way of statement of claim.'\n\"19. In the present case, the matter proceeded by way of application and the objection in\nLake Babine\nto the procedure by way of statement of claim is not relevant.\n\"20. While normally judicial review is conducted with respect to a decision of a federal board, commission or tribunal, there will be occasions where relief may be granted in the absence of a decision. An application for a writ of prohibition is an obvious example. Quo warranto or a declaration in the nature of quo warranto where the challenge is to the right of a public office holder to hold office directly is another. That is what has occurred here. For these reasons, the second ground of appeal must be rejected.\"", "078": "[78]\nThe Applicants have referred the Court to\nCamsell v.

The petitioners in that case sought to have a liquor plebiscite, in which the majority of the community had voted in favour of prohibition, declared void. Irregularities in the voting process included the late opening of a polling station, the manner in which the election lists were compiled (namely, the addition and deletion of names from a municipal election list by the returning officer assisted by an individual familiar with the community members), the failure to provide interpreters at the polling stations in accordance with the plebiscite regulations, a lack of clarity as to the residence requirement for participation in the vote, the failure to meet the requirement of holding an advance poll, discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the number recorded, the failure of the returning officer to take an oath, and the failure to initial the ballots in accordance with the applicable legislation.", "018": "[18]\nThe Respondents, who opposed the Referendum Band Custom initiative, instituted a counter measure to pass a different band custom for Nekaneet.

Chingee\n, supra. There, the terms of the McLeod Lake Indian Band's band custom were purportedly adopted at a general meeting of the band convened with notice. An election was subsequently held in accordance with those terms. The defendants argued that the election was invalid because the terms adopted at the meeting did not actually reflect band custom. In considering this argument, Justice Reed made the following observations at paragraphs 18 and 19:\n\"18. The question that remains is whether 'broad general consensus' equates to a 'majority decision of the Band members attending a general meeting of the Band convened with notice'. In my view, it may do so, or it may not, depending upon a number of factors. If for example, the general meeting was held in a location or at a time when it was difficult for a number of members to attend, and there was no provision for proxy voting, it may not meet the broad consensus test. If the notice was not adequate in not providing sufficient detail of what was proposed, or was not given sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow people a realistic opportunity to attend then it would not be.\n\"19. There are also situations in which those who do not vote may be signaling a willingness to abide by the majority decision of those who do. I am of the view that approval by a majority of the adult members of the Band is probably a safe indication of a broad consensus (the age of majority being a matter for the band to determine). Whether a majority decision by the Band members attending a general meeting demonstrates a broad consensus depends on the circumstances of that meeting.\"\nMadam Justice Reed's statement, which has been quoted in a number of subsequent judgments, confirms that whether information provided is sufficient will depend on the circumstances. If the information documents sent to the membership of Nekaneet provided \"sufficient detail of what was proposed,\" and the information meetings were held at a relatively convenient time and place, with reasonable notice having been given, then it can likely be said that the membership was sufficiently informed.", "057": "[57]\nMore recently, in\nFrancis et al. v.

Significantly, Justice Martineau concluded that such practices may be established either through repetitive acts over time, or through a single act such as the adoption of an electoral code. He says at paragraph 37 that \"whether a particular band resolution, decision or an adopted electoral code reflects the custom of the band can be framed as follows: is the resolution, decision or code based on a majority consensus of all those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band, regardless of residence?\"", "067": "[67]\nThe Respondents say that the Referendum Vote was defective and that the people who voted did not understand the significance of the changes they were voting to bring about.", "023": "[23]\nThe nomination meeting of February 29, 2008 proceeded and Ms. Alice Pahtayken, one of the Applicants, was elected by acclamation as chief.

Although the Respondents seek to preserve the status quo at Nekaneet and claim to embody traditional custom and practice, they have, by and large, been unwilling to allow governance issues to be decided by the Nekaneet people themselves. They have simply resisted, and attempted to thwart, the new initiatives put forward by the Applicants. In the end, the rules of governance at Nekaneet should be decided by the First Nation and it is the will of the Nekaneet people as a whole that matters. The evidence suggests to me that the Respondents have been more concerned to preserve the status quo - and, in particular, the way the chief and band councils are elected and function - than with ascertaining what is the general consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation on appropriate rules of governance. Whatever irregularities arose in the referendum procedure and the general approach of the Applicants, it is at least apparent that their purpose has been to ascertain the will of the Nekaneet people. The new constitution and rules of governance bring no apparent personal advantage to the Applicants, while the Respondents, in their efforts to thwart consensus seeking, are tainted by a strong suggestion of self-interest regarding the control of communal lands and band resources. I think that a party or a group that thwarts attempts to ascertain the general consensus, and simply relies upon traditional custom and practice to justify its own position in a situation where governance has become dysfunctional, invites suspicion;\nb. The Respondents have been clearly aware that community consensus is the true legitimizing factor because, in one very telling way, they have attempted to give themselves that legitimacy. At the second election organized by the Respondents under the Second Band Custom a petition was signed by 113 persons which had the following written above the signatures:\n\"I believe and trust in the Nekaneet Election Procedure of March 28, 2008. Nekaneet Elections have chosen their spokes persons [Band Council members] under the Band Custom process since elections were used on Nekaneet.\"\nThe petition is attached to the affidavit of Mr. Dale Mosquito and the only explanation he offers for it is as follows:\n\"At the time of the conduct of the custom election at Nekaneet, band members were also given the opportunity to sign a petition confirming their commitment to our band custom process. This document was signed by 113 band members. One of the Applicants, Christine Mosquito, and a person who had worked on the Governance Committee, Doreen Oakes, signed this petition. A copy of the petition is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'G' to this my affidavit.\"\nThere is no evidence that it has been Nekaneet custom to have members sign such petitions at election time, and such a petition can only be understood in the context of this dispute. There would be no need to have people sign such a petition unless the Respondents wanted to use it to dispute the legitimacy of the Referendum Vote and the earlier election which took place under the Referendum Band Custom. The petition is the Respondents' attempt to demonstrate community support for the status quo which they profess to embody. It is their answer to the Applicants' Referendum Vote.\nThe strange thing about this is that the criticisms that the Respondents level against the Applicants' Referendum Vote to try and demonstrate that it did not yield a consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation in favour of the new regime are, in fact, true of the petition. There is no evidence to reassure the Court that this petition has any value or legitimacy as an expression of the understanding or the will of the people who signed it. What was the procedure for signing it? What was the information and educative process that preceded it? What were the safegrounds surrounding the signing? Who authorized it? Who organized it? What means did they use to secure the signatures or to ensure that the signators voted freely in accordance with their consciences? We know most of these things about the Referendum Vote. We know none of them about the petition.\nThe Respondents take a strong position in this application that the Nekaneet First Nation did not understand what was at stake under the Referendum Vote. They say the Nekaneet people were not properly informed and that the Referendum Vote was unsafe because of mistakes in the process. They appear to feel no obligation to reassure and demonstrate to the Court that the petition has the legitimacy that they say the Referendum Vote lacks. But without those reassurances, there is little weight that the Court can attach to the petition as an expression of the will of the Nekaneet First Nation.\nWhat is more, the very existence of such a petition undermines some of the basic tenets of the Respondents' position. They say that the governance issues that led to the Referendum Vote were little understood at Nekaneet. Yet they present the Court with a countervailing petition that can only have a significance and a meaning in the context of the governance debate. If these people do not understand what is at stake, why would they be signing a petition so obviously intended to counter the Referendum Vote and the first election? The Court cannot accept that the people who signed the petition understood its significance and what was at stake while the people who participated in the Referendum Vote were not sufficiently informed to know what they were doing. The petition is strong evidence of the Applicants' position that the governance issues at stake in the Referendum Vote were widely known and debated in the Nekaneet community;\nc. The governance debate at Nekaneet is between those who wish to preserve a status quo that has led to significant problems for the community as a whole. The Respondents insist that all band council initiatives require a consensus of council members. The problem with this is that it can only work where no self-interest enters into the picture. Any band council business that threatens the personal, family or friendship interests of a councillor can be thwarted by absenteeism and/or veto. The evidence reveals ongoing dysfunction at the band council level in recent years that has led to warnings from Nekaneet's auditors and INAC. Tradition and custom have been summoned by the Respondents' group to justify a traditional consensual approach, but it is obvious from the evidence that self-interest has sullied custom and that if a new approach to governance is not found, those who control communal assets may continue to prosper at the expense of the Nekaneet First Nation as a whole. There is a great deal of personal bitterness in the evidence and the somewhat extreme measures used by the Respondents to boycott, thwart and nullify the referendum process, rather than seek the consensus of the Nekaneet community as a whole, suggest that some individuals at least have much to lose from the new governance regime. There is evidence of nepotism on the Applicants' side too, but the Applicants are not seeking to extend the opportunities for personal and family gain. The new constitution will pinch them just as much as the Respondents and will make both groups much more accountable to the Nekaneet membership;\nd. I have carefully reviewed the affidavits provided by both sides. While there is considerable contradiction on some key points, it is clear that the affidavits of Ms. Pahtayken, Ms. Millar and Mr. Buffalo Calf for the Applicants are, for the most, fact-based and present evidence within their personal knowledge. Their affidavits are also supported by solid documentation that addresses the key issues in this dispute. The affidavits of Mr. Wenaas and Mr. Alger for the Applicants come from experienced and impartial observers and participants and are strongly supportive of the Applicants' position. The affidavits from the Respondents speak well and convincingly of tradition and custom at Nekaneet, and of the special history of the Nekaneet people. But they are much less convincing when it comes to the key issues in this application. Apart from defending personal positions, they are very thin on acceptable evidence concerning the referendum process, and the knowledge of the community as to what was at stake. There is considerable resort to hearsay, vagueness and personal opinion on key points. As an example, when I examine the affidavit of Mr. Dale Mosquito, for Respondents, it is evident that Mr. Mosquito does speak to some matters of personal experience, but much of what he says is generalized opinion or argument, often on points that are not relevant to the central issue of concern in this application. In addition, when he does get down to the principal issues, Mr. Mosquito reveals a lack of objectivity. He is willing to opine to things of which he has no personal knowledge in order to discredit the Applicants and bolster the Respondents case:\n\"40. Members of the Governance Committee travelled to various locations both in Canada and the United States to meet with some band members on an individual basis. I am advised by Santana and Belinda Stanley, by two of my sisters-in-law, that they were approached to vote by Harry Buffalo Calf and Cheryl Stanley. One of the two did cast a ballot when she agreed to vote in favour of what the Governance Committee was proposing. When the second individual indicated she was not in favour, these individuals would not take her ballot. I am advised however that the persons picking up the ballots did not discuss specifics of what members were being asked to vote on. This does not appear to be an isolated occurrence. I have been advised by other band members that members of the so-called Governance Committee or those working with them, visited members in several locations.\n\"41. I have spoken to one member of the Nekaneet First Nation who indicated to me that he voted in favour but did not understand what he was voting for.\"", "005": "[5]\nThe Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (INAC) has refused to acknowledge either the Applicants or the Respondents as the official Nekaneet band council.

I believe that the process leading to the Referendum Vote, if not perfect, was sufficiently informative for the Nekaneet First Nation to know what was at stake and what they were voting for. And I also believe that the voting process itself, notwithstanding the mistakes that were made, allowed a consensus to emerge, even in the face of the obstructive, and sometimes hostile, tactics of the Respondents, which shows that the Nekaneet First Nation favour the transparency and accountability embodied in the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nover the dysfunctional and partisan situation that many members think exists at Nekaneet and that favours some individuals and groups over others. It looks to me as though the Nekaneet people have spoken and that a broad consensus does not favour the Respondents' position on these governance issues.", "032": "[32]\nIn light of this guidance from the Federal Court of Appeal, I regard the application before me as legitimately engaging the Court's jurisdiction under the\nFederal Courts\nAct\nand the\nFederal Courts Rules\n.", "038": "[38]\nThis being the case, I think that the easiest way to approach these issues is to decide whether the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nnow govern Nekaneet chief and band council elections and, if they do, whether the Respondents rightly occupy their offices in accordance with the relevant provisions. If they do not then, provided the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\ncan be considered as valid and as governing the election of chief and band councils within the Nekaneet First Nation, the Applicants will be the rightful chief and band council because there is no evidence or allegation before me that they were not elected in accordance with the Referendum Band Custom under the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n.", "054": "[54]\nThe jurisprudence on what will constitute a sufficient consensus is somewhat sparse, but I think the relevant principles upon which to resolve the present impasse are clear. In\nBigstone et al. v. Big Eagle et al.\n(1992), [1993] 1 C.N.L.R. 25; 52 F.T.R. 109 (T.D.) at para. 20, Justice Strayer had the following to say of general import:\n\"Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, 'custom' must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus ... . The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the Band?\"", "080": "[80]\nAs the Applicants point out, this latter point has formed the basis of a number of decisions upholding election votes. This is seen, for example, in\nSamson Indian Band v. Cutknife\n(2003), [2004] 1 C.N.L.R. 330; 235 F.T.R. 288 (T.D.). There, the Electoral Supervisor of a councillors' election granted an extension of 24 hours for candidates to deliver the required notarized photographs, and for one of the candidates to submit the required election fees. This formed the basis of an appeal of the election to the Election Appeal Board, which found that the Electoral Supervisor had acted without authority in making the extensions, and ordered a new election. In an application for judicial review, Justice Martineau quashed the Appeal Board's decision. He noted that the Electoral Supervisor has broad general authority to conduct the administration and process of the election, which included the ability to make decisions respecting procedure. He held that granting the extensions was within the Electoral Supervisor's authority, and that doing so was consistent with, and did not defeat, the purpose of the Election Law.", "084": "[84]\nLac des Mille Lacs First Nation et al. v. Hogan et al.\n(2000), 198 F.T.R. 48 (T.D.) is another case in which an election was held to be void, but again it involved more serious irregularities than the procedural matters in the case at bar. In concluding that the leadership review and election were of no force and effect, Justice Gibson stated as follows at paragraph 21:\n\"None of these unique features of the Selection Code was respected in the process leading up to and including the leadership review and election purportedly conducted on the 29th of April, 2000. There was no evidence before me that notice of the events scheduled for the 29th of April was broadly distributed among members of the First Nation. Similarly, there was no evidence whatsoever that those members of the First Nation who would likely be unable to attend a meeting in Thunder Bay would be accommodated by communication processes or voting processes that would allow them to effectively take part.\"\nIn other words, the election in that case was voided not because of mere procedural irregularities, but because non-compliance with the Selection Code resulted in certain members losing the opportunity to vote. It does not appear to me that any of the steps taken by Mr. Walter Wenaas in the present case would have had the effect of disenfranchising any of the members of Nekaneet; rather, it appears that he was simply attempting to, in the words of Justice Vertes, \"facilitate the right to vote.\"\nConclusions", "017": "[17]\nThe\nNekaneet Constitution\nbrings into being an independent Nekaneet appeal body. The\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n, under section 19, sets out the rules for applications to the appeal body.", "015": "[15]\nSection 5.02 of the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nrequires that a candidate running for office not be indebted to Nekaneet if such debt is outstanding for more than 90 days prior to the relevant nomination meeting.", "010": "[10]\nThe Referendum Vote was conducted under the charge of Mr. Walter Wenaas as Referendum Officer, who was independent of Nekaneet.", "063": "[63]\nInstead of putting their position to the whole community, the Respondents held their own election in accordance with traditional custom and, more importantly, organized the petition of 113 signatures as a way of undermining the consensus reflected in the Referendum Vote.", "079": "[79]\nThe plebiscite regulations in\nCamsell\nprovided that the provisions of the\nMunicipal\nAct\napplied to the vote, \"with such modifications as the circumstances require[d]\" (paragraph 6). Justice Marshall noted that two of the irregularities resulted from the Returning Officer applying such modifications due to the limited time available in preparing for the vote. He then reviewed the applicable authorities, noting that elections \"should not be too easily overturned,\" and noting that irregularities will virtually always occur in an election in one form or another (paragraph 52). He then summarized the law in this way at paragraph 55:\n\"So the rule then, on a review of these authorities and subject to statutory modification, could be stated, in my view as follows: That the vote should be vitiated, only if it is shown that there were such irregularities that, on a balance of probabilities, the result of the election might have been different. And, secondly, that the vote could not be said to have been a vote, that is, that it was not conducted generally in accordance with electoral practice under existing statutes.\"\nJustice Marshall held that the election in\nCamsell\nwas conducted generally in accordance with the principles for conducting such an election. He also held that the petitioners had failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that because of the irregularities which occurred, there might have been a different result. His reasoning with respect to the non-initialling of ballots, particularly relevant in the present circumstances, was as follows, at paragraph 27:\n\"The petitioners tendered evidence that none of the ballots were initialled, as required by s. 51(j) of the\nMunicipal\nAct\n, and, therefore, they contend that under a strict interpretation of that\nAct\n, again none of the ballots should count. The purpose of the process is to ensure that the ballots are legitimate. The requirement, in my view, is directive, not mandatory. There is considerable authority for this interpretation [Footnote: See\nBlackburn v. Moss\n(1986), 12 O.A.C. 387 (Div. Ct.), and\nMorgan v. Simpson\n, [1974] 3 All E.R. 722 at 725 (C.A.)]. Again, in this regard, there was no evidence that the practice had led to any impropriety in the casting or recording of the vote, which might otherwise have changed the vote.\"\nJustice Marshall added at paragraph 63 that \"... [w]ith regard to the failure to initial the ballots, there is not a shred of evidence that this affected the result in any way.\" Justice Marshall concluded that, as there was no evidence that the irregularities affected the result of the vote, the petition should be dismissed and the election upheld.", "065": "[65]\nHad the Respondents been truly concerned with ascertaining the general will of the Nekaneet First Nation on the matters in dispute, they would have placed the issues squarely before the Nekaneet people and either participated in the referendum or found some other way to allow the Nekaneet First Nation to decide these issues for itself. Rather than allow the community to express its will in a fair and transparent way, the Respondents have attempted to thwart the referendum process in order to preserve a status quo that, the evidence suggests, is more conducive to their personal interests. Bearing in mind this general pattern, the Court cannot accept the petition as an indication of how all of the people signing it would have voted in a free and transparent process. It is obvious that the Respondents have family and supporters who will always vote with them. But I do not think the Respondents can have it both ways. They cannot snipe at, and complain of, defects in the referendum process, and then bring forward a petition that was organized and obtained in a way that is not transparent on the evidence. The Respondents cannot boycott and thwart a referendum process aimed at ascertaining the general will at Nekaneet and then offer a petition that has no fair and due process attached to it to support their own legitimacy in the community.", "008": "[8]\nThe election of the Applicants as the band council of Nekaneet was based on a band custom passed at the Referendum Vote of the eligible voters of Nekaneet residing both on and off reserve and held on February 25, 2008. The Referendum Vote approved the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nwhich together formed the Referendum Band Custom which was intended to replace any previous band customs of Nekaneet. The Referendum Band Custom further required that it could only be amended or repealed by a subsequent referendum held in accordance with the\nNekaneet Constitution\n.", "061": "[61]\nGiven the fact that the Respondents and their supporters refused to participate in the referendum process and the Referendum Vote because that would have meant consenting to something they wished to thwart, this seems to me to be a remarkably high turn out and a clear endorsement of the new regime as a custom of the Nekaneet First Nation.", "035": "[35]\nThe application for quo warranto, or a declaration in the nature of quo warranto, which the Applicants seek is aimed at the Second Band Custom under which the Respondents were purportedly elected on March 14, 2008.

It also identified ten core laws of Nekaneet to ensure standards for good government and accountability (Article 9.07 of the\nNekaneet Constitution\n). Further, it also confirmed the Rule of Law for Nekaneet.", "082": "[82]\nSimilarly, in the present case, Mr. Walter Wenaas had authority under the voting rules to make rules as to matters of procedure. He was entitled to take the steps that he did in administering the referendum. This argument is particularly strong with respect to measures that he took which could be said to have furthered the electoral process, such as allowing band members to have their completed ballots picked up rather than requiring them to mail the ballots back. This was \"consistent with the purpose\" of the referendum rules, and should not affect the validity of the vote.", "039": "[39]\nI agree with the Applicants that there is no requirement under the\nIndian Act\nor any other legislation that has been brought to the Court's attention that requires a referendum band custom process to be initiated or passed in a specified way. The issue is whether the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nhave been adopted by, and are acceptable to, a broad consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation, as \"broad consensus\" is defined by the governing jurisprudence. If it has been so adopted and accepted then the Nekaneet people have decided that it will govern future chief and band council elections, and elections that do not comply with the relevant provisions will not be valid.", "070": "[70]\nIn addition to the voting results, the process associated with the development and approval of the Referendum Band Custom is relevant to the issue of whether there was a \"broad consensus\" and, in that regard, the following should be noted, even though the Respondents take issue with some of these facts:\na. The referendum process commenced on February 23, 2007 and ended with the Referendum Vote on February 25, 2008;\nb. Approximately 60 band members who were in attendance at the band meeting of February 23, 2007 initiated the governance committee initiative;\nc. Thirty-four written responses from members were provided naming prospective persons to sit on the governance committees;\nd. The Nekaneet Governance Committee held five meetings;\ne. Two questionnaires with 46 responses from the membership on the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand 46 responses on the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n(initially called the\nNekaneet Election Act\n), reveal that the contents of the majority of responses are aligned with the core ingredients of the\nNekaneet Constitution\nof the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nrelating to the accountability and transparency;\nf. Two consultation meetings were held with the membership, one held in Regina, Saskatchewan and the other held on Nekaneet Reserve, where the members were given an opportunity to provide verbal input;\ng. The draft\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the draft\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nwere circulated prior to the Referendum Vote;\nh. An Information Document regarding the subject of the vote was circulated prior to the Referendum Vote;\ni. An Information Meeting was held on February 4, 2008 giving the Nekaneet Membership an opportunity to discuss the matters of concern regarding the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n;\nj. The\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nand the associated Referendum Vote were widely discussed and hotly debated within the Nekaneet Community;\nk. The use of an independent and impartial Referendum Officer;\nl. Band members residing off reserve participated in the vote through a mail-in process;\nm. 136 of 267 eligible voters participated in the Referendum Vote, and 83% of those who voted were in favour of the Referendum Band Custom.", "056": "[56]\nThis position is confirmed by Justice Reed in\nChingee et al. v. Chingee et al.\n(1998), [1999] 1 C.N.L.R. 106; 153 F.T.R. 257 (T.D.) at paragraph 17 where she refers to what is \"fairly established in the jurisprudence,\" and this is that \"the custom of the band is the practices for selecting the council of the band that are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus.\"", "006": "[6]\nSpecifically, the Applicants are seeking:\n1.

But no evidence has been led to establish that such irregularity materially affected the results.", "086": "[86]\nI do not believe that my conclusions prevent the Respondents from asserting what they regard as traditional interests. The\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\nhave clear provisions for amendments and change. If the Respondents represent a sufficiently broad traditional faction in the community, they can invoke the amending provisions and attempt to win community support for their way of doing things. But the new constitution does ensure that community support is needed and that governance is a matter for the Nekaneet First Nation as a whole and cannot be controlled by an entrenched interest group from either side of the cultural and political divide.", "066": "[66]\nIn my view then, the Referendum Vote satisfies, on its face, the jurisprudence for establishing a broad consensus at Nekaneet for the new governance regime and an abandonment of the old ways. The next question is whether the Referendum Vote was the result of a fair and open election in which the voters knew what they were doing when they adopted the new governance regime as custom at Nekaneet.\nCriticisms of Respondents", "043": "[43]\nThere is some conflict in the evidence before me in this application. This is inevitable given the different approaches to governance that each side represents. The Applicants see themselves as bringing a new, more transparent and more accountable approach to governance of the Nekaneet First Nation. The Respondents, on the other hand, see themselves as the embodiment of traditional custom and practice that does not need the new approach found in the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n. In fact, the Respondents regard these instruments as being totally at odds with traditional custom and practice and as detrimental to the identity of the Nekaneet First Nation.", "087": "[87]\nI render judgment in this case with some reluctance because I am, in effect, pronouncing on the collective will of the Nekaneet First Nation as expressed in a broad consensus vote. That feels presumptuous to me, to say the least. The will of the Nekaneet people, in my view, is a matter for the Nekaneet First Nation. However, counsel for both sides have informed me that the present application is the only viable way of resolving the impasse at Nekaneet over governance in a timely way. I have simply reviewed the materials placed before me and attempted to formulate what I believe those materials reveal concerning what the people of Nekaneet want to happen in terms of governance. I am well aware that Court applications do not reveal everything, particularly summary proceedings such as this judicial review application. Hence, my conclusions will not please everyone at Nekaneet. But taking into account the method of resolution selected in this case, this is the best I can do for the Nekaneet First Nation and I hope that it will bring some respite from the divisiveness that has been hampering the community.\nJUDGMENT", "020": "[20]\nIt is not known how many band members were in attendance or otherwise participated in the meeting that created the Second Band Custom.", "002": "[2]\nThis application concerns two separate elections which took place on March 28, 2008, notionally creating two separate Nekaneet band councils elected pursuant to two different band customs. The purpose of the application is to determine which band custom governs band council elections at Nekaneet and which of the two band councils legitimately holds office.", "048": "[48]\nAs regards conflicts in the evidence, I think the Court has to take into account the fact that the Applicants have tried their best to put the governance issues before the Nekaneet First Nation so that the whole community can express itself. There were negative votes in the referendum. That suggests an informed community that knew what it was doing and made a free choice. It is telling that the Respondents petition is presented as though there was no dissent, and that raises doubts about how informed and free the petition process was. Either that or it suggests a block of people who have a vested interest in ensuring that the status quo continues at Nekaneet.", "053": "[53]\nNekaneet has approximately 418 band members, of which 267 were eligible voters at the time of the referendum. One of the problems with a group of people of this size is that loyalties will inevitably divide along family and friendship lines. This makes a clear and overwhelming consensus well nigh possible. As can be seen in the present case, there is a marked polarization between those who want to preserve the status quo and those who want a new approach to governance.", "085": "[85]\nGenerally speaking, this application reveals a personal and ideological struggle at Nekaneet over governance issues. Behind the legalities lie common tensions over such things as custom and accountability, on-reserve and off-reserve interests, traditional spirituality and Christianity, personal interest and community benefit. This kind of summary proceeding cannot address in detail these extremely complex cultural and political flashpoints. In the end they all boil down to the issue of what a consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation wants for itself. A full consensus is impossible over such divisive issues in such a small community. Polarization has led to dysfunctional government, and dysfunctional government has caused problems for the First Nation membership and has begun to deprive the community of the resources it needs to provide services to the people of Nekaneet. It is impossible to please everyone. The only solution is to determine whether there is a sufficient consensus for change.", "049": "[49]\nIt also has to be kept in mind that the process adopted by the Applicants and the new regime endorsed by the Referendum Vote gives rise to no obvious conflicts of interest on the part of the Applicants. Transparency and accountability in governance are something that will apply to the Applicants as much as to the Respondents. But the Respondents want to retain a status quo that, on the evidence, greatly troubles a great many people at Nekaneet who believe it promotes unfairness, nepotism and the pursuit of self-interest over communal well-being. The evidence suggests that the Respondents have a personal interest in the status quo, and this has to affect the way the Court views their evidence and their interpretation of events that lead to the Referendum Vote.", "011": "[11]\nNekaneet has approximately 418 band members, of which 267 were eligible voters at the material time. Of the 267 Nekaneet eligible voters, 136 ballots were cast under the Referendum Vote.

The mail-in ballots all had accompanying completed declarations of identity and both the completed and signed declaration and the ballot were placed in a sealed envelope as provided in the Mail-in voting Package, and such sealed envelope was either sent by mail or delivered to the Referendum Officer. On opening each sealed envelope the Referendum Officer confirmed the identification of the voter as contained in the signed declaration, then proceeded to initial the ballot and put the ballot in the ballot-box. No evidence has been led to show that such irregularity would have materially affected the result;\nb. The Referendum Officer permitted Nekaneet band members to attend and pick up the sealed envelopes containing the completed and signed declarations and ballots as an equally acceptable process to mailing the ballots to the Referendum Officer. The band members who picked up the ballots included members of the Nekaneet Governance Committee. The Referendum Officer had the authority, under the voting rules, to make his own rules as to matters of procedure in administering the Referendum Vote. No evidence has been led that such procedure constituted an irregularity that would have materially affected the results. Further, no evidence has been led that a voter was denied the right to vote either in person or by placing their mail-in ballot in the mail in the usual course.", "062": "[62]\nI note that, in\nLac des Mille Lacs First Nation\n, Justice Cullen held that the participation of 86 voting members out of a population of 300 band members, with a large majority of the 86 in favour of a Custom Leadership Selection Code, was a sufficiently broad consensus to render the code a band custom.", "009": "[9]\nThe election of the Respondents as the band council of Nekaneet was based on the Second Band Custom passed by a show of hands at a Nekaneet band meeting called for such purpose and held on March 14, 2008.", "012": "[12]\nPrior to the Referendum Vote, all previous band customs of Nekaneet were passed by way of show of hands at a meeting of members called for such purpose.", "059": "[59]\nThe evidence before me establishes that a majority of Nekaneet band members participated in the Referendum Vote and a substantial and clear majority voted in favour of the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n.", "028": "[28]\nA timely resolution of the dispute is necessary because the refusal of INAC to acknowledge the Applicants' band council elected under the Referendum Band Custom or the Respondents' band council elected under the Second Band Custom means that non-INAC programs at Nekaneet cannot be managed.", "088": "[88]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n1.

Obviously, the Respondents and their followers knew precisely what was at stake and what the changes would mean. They knew this so well (and they had legal advice) that they were aware they had to boycott and thwart the referendum process to stand a chance of preserving the status quo. They knew it so well that they organized a petition that they say supports the old ways of electing the chief and band councils. So it is pretty hard for the Court to accept as a general proposition that the Respondents and their followers knew what was at stake and, in effect, petitioned against it, but that those Nekaneet people who participated in the Referendum Vote did not. What is more, I believe that other evidence adduced does not support the Respondents' position on this issue. The Applicants' evidence on this issue suggests that, although members of the community may not have understood all of the detail in the documentation that was distributed and which eventually became the\nNekaneet Constitution\nand the\nNekaneet Governance\nAct\n, they were certainly aware that they had a choice to make between a dysfunctional status quo that allowed too much scope for self-interest, and a new governance regime that would bring much more transparency and accountability to Nekaneet in a way that would benefit the community as a whole.", "030": "[30]\nThe Applicants have identified the following issues for the Court to decide:\n1.

If the Referendum Band Custom was validly passed, does it invalidate the Second Band Custom because the Second Band Custom did not come about in accordance with the process contained in the\nNekateet Constitution\n?\nb.

There can be no question that the Tribunal had the authority to impose a remedy against the employer in circumstances where it found the respondent to have suffered a loss. I am in agreement with counsel for the respondent that the principle against which such a remedy is to be determined is that the remedy chosen should, to the greatest extent possible, put the person suffering the damage or loss in the same position in which he or she would have found himself or herself absent the wrong committed. In reviewing a determination as to an appropriate remedy in the context of a breach of a collective agreement, absent a finding of jurisdictional error, would normally regard the standard of review as at or approaching that of reasonableness since the determination of an appropriate remedy in such a context is within the established role and expertise, or \"home jurisdiction\", of the Tribunal. See:\nRoyal Oak Mines\n, supra, p. 404 [S.C.R.].

In these circumstances, overtime cost did not justify denying leave under the guise of operational requirements. The 30-day requirement [the advance notice of requests for leave that the employer sought to require] does not form part of the collective agreement and thus cannot justify the employer's refusal either. Therefore, the employer violated the collective agreement when it refused the requested vacation leave for April 8, 1995. Obviously, it is too late to order the employer to comply with the request of leave for April 8, 1995. I therefore order the employer to grant one day of vacation leave to the grievor, at a time he requests, and on reasonable notice to the employer within the next six months. This day of leave is not to be deducted from the grievor's accumulated vacation leave credits.\n\"I am mindful of the fact that by making this order the grievor is now entitled to a day's vacation leave in addition to his allotment under the terms of the collective agreement. I am also mindful of the fact that there was no evidence before me that denial of leave for April 8, 1995 caused the grievor financial loss or severe hardship. Nonetheless, the grievor was deprived from attending a social function in which he was to receive an award of recognition. Apart from the\ndeception\nthat one would expect any employee to have experienced, there is the fact that the grievor is a shift worker. Thus, social functions are generally more difficult to attend assiduously and are therefore more likely to be treasured.

The Notice filed in\nJones\n(IMM-1877-05) states that by permitting the Board member to conduct an examination-in-chief of the claimant, paragraph 19 breaches the right to a fair and independent judiciary resulting in a reasonable apprehension of bias which is contrary to s. 7 of the\nCharter\n.\nSection 7", "239": "[239]\nThe first two questions suggested by the applicants were two of the questions certified in\nThamotharem\n. The respondent agrees that these be certified in this case and also requests that the third question certified by Justice Blanchard in\nThamotharem\nbe again certified, which I agree should be done.", "228": "[228]\nI note that in\nStumf et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(2002), 289 N.R. 165; 2002 FCA 148, the Court of Appeal allowed the applicants to raise an issue in oral arguments which had not been raised in the judicial review or in any of the proceedings before the Board. The issue in this case was the failure of the Board to consider the designation of a representative for a minor refugee applicant as required by s. 69(4) of the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. The Court determined that it was appropriate to consider it at that time because the record disclosed all of the relevant facts, and there was no suggestion that the Minister would be prejudiced if the issue was considered.", "050": "[50]\nThe applicants submit that refugee determination proceedings are quasi-judicial in nature because the Board has some of the trappings of a judicial body, adjudicates on individual rights, is statutorily mandated to hold hearings to make findings of fact, and must identify the relevant laws and apply them to the facts as found. Accordingly, the applicants submit, the procedures employed by the Board will not meet minimum standards of fairness if they deviate significantly from the curial mode. Moreover, as held in\nSingh\n, administrative convenience and considerations such as the interest of the tribunal in quicker resolution of cases cannot be determinative of fundamental justice principles. That is the important difference, they submit, between a natural justice argument and a fundamental justice argument - the needs of the tribunal, relevant to a natural justice analysis, cannot trump the\nCharter\nrights of the individual.", "037": "[37]\nOne applicant, Shurlyn Jones (IMM-1877-05), submits that it is never permissible for a RPD member, in the absence of an RPO, to engage in questioning the claimant prior to claimant's counsel and that this practice results in an apprehension of institutional bias and undermines claimants' right to an impartial and independent tribunal.", "195": "[195]\nJustice Gonthier noted that in applying this test, greater flexibility must be shown to administrative tribunals than would be required of the courts and the institutional constraints under which the tribunals operate must be taken into account. Moreover, a plurality of functions in a single administrative agency is not necessarily problematic.", "134": "[134]\nThe factors relied upon by Justice Blanchard in arriving at this conclusion are set out in paragraph 135 of his reasons which I reproduce below in part:\n\"In the instant case, I am satisfied that there is significant evidence that the IRB made known to its members that they are expected to comply with the guideline save in exceptional cases. The problem is not so much with the expression of this expectation by the IRB, but rather its combination with a number of factors: the monitoring and expectation of compliance, the evidence of compliance, and especially the mandatory language of Guideline 7. These factors, in my view, all serve to fetter Board Members' discretion. As Mr. Aterman acknowledged in testimony given on cross-examination: 'It's a balancing which respects adjudicative independence on the one hand and the public and institutional interests in consistency on the other hand.' In the circumstances of this case, the balancing of these interests, essentially because of the mandatory language used in Guideline 7, results in the interests of consistency outweighing the adjudicative independence of the Board Member. The mandatory language of Guideline 7, the limited and narrow description of exceptional circumstances provided for in the guideline and the not so subtly expressed expectation of compliance by the IRB, all combine to limit a Board Member's discretion. The fact that there are cases where a Board Member has chosen not to follow the guideline does not cure these deficiencies. ...\"", "133": "[133]\nIn\nThamotharem\n, Justice Blanchard determined that the implementation of Guideline 7 had the effect of fettering a Board member's discretion to decide the most appropriate process to follow in the circumstances of each case. Fundamental to the right of a fair hearing is that a Board member exercise independent judgment in deciding a case on its merits free from undue influence. Such fettering, in Justice Blanchard's view, constitutes undue influence upon the member and violates the principles of procedural fairness.", "118": "[118]\nTo illustrate, the applicants point to the case of applicant Gutierrez Trujillo (IMM-2709-05) in which a psychological report had been submitted to the Board indicating that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress that could affect his ability to testify. The Board Member did not refer to this evidence in making his determination that the Guideline 7 order should be maintained. The applicants submit that fairness cannot be ensured by a case-by-case determination of the order of questioning if such evidence can be readily discounted or overlooked. Moreover, they submit, such a process would not contribute to the efficient use of the Board's resources. The only practical approach to the reality that many claimants have vulnerabilities which would make it fairer for their counsel to question them first, is to require this as the normal procedure.", "058": "[58]\nI note that in\nChieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84; 280 N.R. 268; 2002 SCC 3, at para. 19, Justice Iacobucci stated that it was not necessary to consider the scope of s. 7 in a case arising in the immigration context as it could be decided on administrative law principles and statutory interpretation. The same conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in\nBaker\n, above, at para. 11. In\nBell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex et al.\n, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559; 287 N.R. 248; 166 B.C.A.C. 1; 271 W.A.C. 1; 2002 SCC 42, the Court discouraged litigants from seeking the use of \"\nCharter\nvalues\" to interpret legislation when it was not absolutely necessary to resolve ambiguity.", "052": "[52]\nThe issue was framed in somewhat different terms during oral argument.

Counsel suggested, however, that the issue before the Court was slightly more subtle:\n\"It is whether or not within the context of a refugee hearing the right to be heard ... encompasses the right of counsel to determine whether or not he will examine in chief.\" (Transcript at 76)", "041": "[41]\nFurther, the respondent submits that any applicants who did not object to the Guideline 7 procedure in a timely manner before the refugee hearing or in their applications for leave to this Court, should not now be permitted to claim a denial of procedural fairness.", "211": "[211]\nIt appears, therefore, that the jurisprudence of this Court regarding when an applicant must raise an objection to the order of questioning in order to have it dealt with upon judicial review is unsettled. In order to arrive at the correct approach to be applied in these consolidated cases I will rely upon the general principles of waiver developed in the jurisprudence.", "031": "[31]\nIn Montreal and Ottawa, it appears the practice described in Guideline 7 was more common but was not mandatory before June, 2004. In those cities, counsel could ask to question their clients first and were frequently accommodated by the Board members.", "142": "[142]\nThe finding in\nThamotharem\nthat members' discretion is fettered turns on the language of the Guideline itself and the extrinsic evidence about how it could be interpreted and applied by RPD members and not on the facts of the particular case.", "078": "[78]\nHaving closely reviewed the reasons in each of the cases cited above and considered the arguments of counsel, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions reached by my colleague in\nThamotharem\non the correct interpretation of these prior decisions. While the reasons for decision contain statements which may be construed as lending support for the notion that a fair hearing requires that the claimant's counsel question first, a close examination discloses that the Court in each case was more concerned with whether the hearing, as a whole, was fair than with the order of questioning. The order of questioning may have contributed to unfairness in a particular case but was not determinative of that finding.", "018": "[18]\nUnder the authority of a provision in the precedessor statute, s. 65(3) of the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution were issued in 1993 and updated in November 1996. The Guidelines on Civilian Non-Combatants Fearing Persecution in Civil War Situations were issued in March 1996, Guidelines on Child Refugee Claimants in August 1996, Guidelines on Detention on March 12, 1998.

Following a review of each case, Justice Blanchard expressed the following conclusion at paragraph 46 of his reasons:\n\"In my opinion, in none of these cases did the Court establish that the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness require that refugee claimants be questioned by their counsel first. In fact, whether the Board's choice of the order of questioning accorded with natural justice or procedural fairness was not before the Court in any of the cases. The cases all dealt with specific circumstances in which the Court held that the Refugee Board's conduct of the hearing was improper or led to an error in the Board's findings of fact.\"\nAnd further at paragraph 53:\n\"In my opinion, the cases cited by the Applicant and the Intervener do not lead to the conclusion that a meaningful opportunity to present one's case includes a right to question first. Rather, they reaffirm that the Board is entitled to control the procedures of a hearing but that the Board must conduct the hearing in a way that does not unfairly restrict the claimant's right to present her or his case.\"", "149": "[149]\nIn exhibit A-4 the Member stated the following:\n\"Je vais suivre une autre procedure aujourd'hui.

While troubling, it does not in itself justify the conclusion that this was a broadly held view among Board members.", "098": "[98]\nIn my view, the conclusion that the process was intended by Parliament to be inquisitorial rather than adversarial in nature is supported on the face of the legislation. Notwithstanding Professor Galloway's evidence and the Court's awareness of egregious examples of hostile and aggressive questioning, I am not persuaded that a failure to respect that intent by RPOs or Board members in individual cases establishes that the hearings are adversarial. The process was not designed to be a contest between parties adverse in interest but rather an inquiry into whether a claim to Canada's protection is being legitimately made. In that context, a close examination of the merits of the claim is consistent with the nature of the process and the roles of the member and the RPO.", "090": "[90]\nThe applicants submit that the enactment by Parliament in\nIRPA\nof provisions for a Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), combined with the failure of the Governor-in-Council to bring the RAD into effect enhances the duty of fairness owed to the applicant and decreases the deference owed by the Court to a decision of the Board on refugee protection. The applicants submit that the duty is greater and deference less than if the appeal provisions had not been legislated.", "182": "[182]\nThe respondent's answer is that the Chairperson clearly has the statutory authority to issue guidelines to Board members. Parliament has legislated that the RPD must hold a hearing and give claimants a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations; however a tribunal is free, within reason, to determine its own procedures. The respondent further argues that the role of the panel is properly characterized as inquisitorial in nature, not adversarial, and therefore a member can lead the inquiry into the claim:\nSivasamboo v.

A failure to object at the hearing must be taken as an implied waiver of any perceived unfairness resulting from the application of the Guideline itself.", "114": "[114]\nThe applicants submit that a number of considerations common to refugee claimants underscore the need to allow claimants' counsel to conduct an examination-in-chief in refugee proceedings.

Distrust of individuals in general and government agents in particular;\n2. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder;\n3. Suppression and/or Repression of memories;\n4. Anxiety and Panic Attacks; and\n5.

If applicants are permitted to obtain judicial review of adverse decisions by remaining silent in the face of known problems of interpretation, they will remain silent. This will result in a duplication of hearings. It seems a better policy to provide an incentive to make the original hearing as fair as possible and to avoid repetitious proceedings. Applicants should be required to complain at the first opportunity when it is reasonable to expect them to do so.\"\nJustice Pelletier went on to say at para. 26 \"[t]he crucial element is the reasonableness of the expectation that the claimant complain at the first opportunity\".", "099": "[99]\nWhile Refugee Protection Officers and Board members receive training and guidance on how to question effectively and how to deal with vulnerable claimants, it is not surprising that there will be cases in which the questioning crosses a line as to what is acceptable in terms of fairness. One should not assume from these exceptions that all hearings take on an adversarial tone and that the procedures adopted should mirror those used in a courtroom setting. The process does not require recognition of a higher procedural standard, such as the right to an examination-in-chief, but rather greater attention to ensuring that the hearing as a whole is conducted fairly.\nLegitimate Expectation", "226": "[226]\nRule 301 of the\nFederal Court Rules\n, sets out the requirements for an application for judicial review.

He noted, however, at paragraph 103 of his reasons that while the enactment explicitly authorized the Chairperson to make and issue guidelines to assist members in carrying out their duties, the guidelines cannot be mandatory in the sense that they leave little room for the exercise of discretion by each Board member to conduct a full and proper hearing. Were that the intent, the proper course of action would be to make a s. 161 rule.

In giving weight to the choices made by the Board respecting its procedures, it is not necessary for the Court to conclude that these procedures have been effective or the best choice. That choice is for the Board to make, recognizing always that the application of the Board's procedures in an individual case may result in a denial of fairness. It is not appropriate, in my view, for the Court, in hindsight, to substitute its own view of what procedure would be preferable unless it is necessary to ensure natural justice.\n\"Other\" Factors", "214": "[214]\nThe reasoning of Justice MacGuigan was applied by the Court of Appeal in\nYassine v.

Justice Stone for the Court stated at paragraph 7:\n\"It must also be noted that no objection was taken to the procedure that the Presiding Member adopted for receiving the additional information ... That surely was the time to raise an objection and to ask the panel to reconvene the hearing, assuming that the information could not otherwise be received. The appellant was then in possession of all of the new information and was aware that the panel intended to take notice of it.\nNot only was no objection made at that time, which I would regard as the 'earliest practicable opportunity' to do so ... the appellant remained silent until after the Refugee Division's decision was released on April 18, 1991. Thus, even if a breach of natural justice did occur, I view the appellant's conduct as an implied waiver of that breach.\n\" (Emphasis added and citation omitted)", "190": "[190]\nThis applicant argues that this is a constitutional issue going directly to the independence of the tribunal. It matters not whether Guideline 7 was implemented as a guideline or a rule, because the result remains the same.

This situation would be obviated if RPOs were present at every hearing and conducted the initial questioning as the\nRules\nappear to contemplate.

On that evidence in these proceedings, I am not satisfied that the applicants have demonstrated that the discretion of RPD members to determine the procedure to be followed in the refugee proceedings before them has been fettered by the implementation of Guideline 7.", "203": "[203]\nIn my view, the question of bias in this context has to be raised on a case-by-case basis. I note, without deciding the matter, that in the Jones application record there is evidence of what counsel described as \"long, nasty, brutish and hostile\" examination of the claimant by the Member. That evidence may support a finding that in the particular circumstances of that case, a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out. That is to be decided by the judge hearing the merits of the case. It does not, in my view, support a finding that institutional bias results from the questioning order called for by Guideline 7.\nWhen must an objection to the use of Guideline 7 be raised?", "169": "[169]\nThere is also evidence of e-mails from the Vice-Chair inquiring whether members were applying the guidelines and that members were asked to explain whether there were exceptional circumstances or other reasons for not following them.

The Order also instructed that any remaining issues on each of the consolidated cases were to be determined in separate hearings presided over by one or more different judges, on dates that are as early as practicable following the expedited hearing of the Guideline 7 issues.

Accordingly, the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(\nIRPA\n) requires the IRB to deal with proceedings before it informally, quickly and fairly. The Chairperson has issued these guidelines to explain what the RPD does before and during the hearing to make its proceedings more efficient but still fair. The guidelines also set out what the RPD expects participants to do.\n\"The guidelines apply to most cases heard by the RPD. However, in compelling or exceptional circumstances, the members will use their discretion not to apply some guidelines or to apply them less strictly.\n\"Generally speaking, the RPD will make allowances for unrepresented claimants who are unfamiliar with the Division's processes and rules. Claimants identified as particularly vulnerable will be treated with special sensitivity.\"", "223": "[223]\nThe respondent submits that the Court should not consider grounds for judicial review that were not expressly pleaded in the applications for leave. In these proceedings, several applicants raised the Guideline 7 issue in their memoranda of fact and law or supplementary memoranda for the first time after the release of the decision in\nThamotharem\n.", "093": "[93]\nWith respect to the first factor, Justice Blanchard found that Parliament intended the RPD procedure to be less judicial and more inquisitorial. He concluded at paragraph 75, after comparing RPD hearings with court proceedings, that the RPD hearing was not an adversarial process notwithstanding the often aggressive and probing nature of questioning by RPOs and members. However, because the nature of the decision calls for the Board to adjudicate issues that have an impact on the rights of refugee claimants he concluded that a higher level of procedural protection is warranted.", "216": "[216]\nIn\nZ\u00fcndel v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.\n(2000), 264 N.R. 174; 195 D.L.R.(4th) 399 (F.C.A.) (\nZundel\n), the Court of Appeal considered the question of whether the doctrine of waiver may be relied upon in the face of a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias. The appellant had cited\nNewfoundland Telephone Co. v. Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities (Nfld.)\n, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 623; 134 N.R. 241; 95 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271; 301 A.P.R. 271; 89 D.L.R.(4th) 289 (\nNewfoundland Telephone\n), for the proposition that a finding of bias rendered the hearing void, leaving no room for waiver to operate.\nNewfoundland Telephone\n, however, did not address the question of waiver and the objection to the proceedings was raised at the very outset.", "089": "[89]\nWith respect to the second factor, the nature of the decision making process in the legislative scheme,\nBaker\n, above, at paragraph 24, indicates that the lack of a right of appeal suggests a higher degree of procedural protection will be required.", "198": "[198]\nIn\nKozak\n, above, at paragraphs 51-57, the Federal Court of Appeal noted three considerations of particular relevance to the question of bias in the context of RPD decision making. First, that the content of the duty of fairness owed by the Board falls at the high end of the continuum of procedural fairness. Secondly, that the Board has a particularly difficult mandate of administrative adjudication. And third, that the notion of bias connotes circumstances giving rise to a reasonable and informed belief that the decision maker has been influenced by some extraneous or improper considerations.", "143": "[143]\nAt paragraph 119 of his reasons, Justice Blanchard found that the language of Guideline 7 left little doubt that the thrust of the Guideline indicates to Board members a mandatory process rather than a recommended but optional process: paragraph 19 provides that the standard practice\nwill be\nfor the RPO to begin, and if no RPO is participating at the hearing, the Board member\nwill\nbegin. Further, while paragraph 23 allowed for the Board member to vary the order of questioning, the basis for the finding by the Court in\nZaki\nthat it was sufficiently flexible, Justice Blanchard found that it set a high threshold for what constitutes \"exceptional circumstances\": the claimant must be \"severely\" disturbed and the child must be \"very\" young for an exception to apply. He concluded that while these may be just examples, they restrict the sort of circumstances that may warrant an exception. He went on to state these views on the language used in Guideline 7:\n\"The use of qualifiers such as 'severely' and 'very' leave little doubt that the scope of 'such circumstances' contemplated by the guideline is limited. There may well be circumstances which do not fit within the scope of those 'exceptional circumstances' contemplated in Guideline 7 which, in the discretion of the Board Member, would warrant proceeding otherwise than by the standard order of questioning. The language of paragraph 23 may leave a member with the impression that he or she has no option but to follow the guideline in such cases. At the very least, in my view, paragraph 23 by requiring 'exceptional circumstances' for straying from the norm deters the member from considering other factors before deciding what order of questioning is appropriate. Guideline 7 would in effect, in such a case, serve to fetter the member's discretion.\"", "094": "[94]\nThe applicants submit that the characterization of the refugee determination process as non-adversarial is suspect when the role of counsel for the claimant is compared to that of the RPO. Counsel's role is to demonstrate that the claimant is a person in need of protection. By contrast, the role of the RPO is, in part they submit, to flush out any weaknesses in the claimant's case which may lead to a determination that a person is not a person in need of protection. In this sense, the applicants contend the roles of counsel and the RPO are opposed.", "167": "[167]\nWith regard to the second\nAinsley\nfactor, the practical effect of non-compliance with the guideline, the threat of coercive action is not made out on the facts. There is no evidence on the record to suggest that the Chairperson has threatened to, or has in fact, sanctioned any Board member for non-compliance with Guideline 7. Indeed, the Chairperson does not have that authority. The evidence is that at least one Member, Mr. Ellis, has refused to implement the Guideline from the outset and there is no evidence that he has been sanctioned in any way.", "055": "[55]\nIn the applicants' submissions, this vulnerability requires that the highest order of procedural protection be applied in refugee determinations and that the application of Guideline 7 be reviewed on fundamental justice standards. In my view, that vulnerability calls for sensitivity and discretion to be exercised by whomever is examining the claimant. Experienced RPOs and Board members may be more adept at it than inexperienced or poorly trained counsel.", "021": "[21]\nAt paragraph 30 of the second affidavit, Mr. Aterman states that prior to the issuance of Guideline 7, the order of questioning at RPD hearings varied regionally within the IRB. Guideline 7 introduced a national standard order of questioning. His affidavit further describes the consultations that were undertaken with interested non-governmental organizations prior to the implementation of the guideline which resulted in steps being taken by the Board to respond to concerns raised. These included internal training sessions on questioning and a six month phase-in period from December 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004 during which the standard order was implemented only with the claimant's consent.", "075": "[75]\nI have had the benefit of the thorough review of that question which Justice Blanchard conducted together with the submissions of counsel in these proceedings which have largely focused on his analysis.", "032": "[32]\nAccording to Mr. Aterman's affidavit evidence, the standard order of questioning was introduced as part of an Action Plan to increase the Board's efficiency, decrease the average time of a hearing and reduce burdens on the Board's resources while maintaining fairness. The applicants challenge these assertions as unfounded and unwarranted. The change, they say, has had little effect on hearing times or the overall disposition rate for refugee determinations but has denied claimants their rights to the effective assistance of counsel and to be heard, both of which are aspects of fundamental justice and procedural fairness.\nISSUES", "115": "[115]\nThe respondent concedes that some refugee claimants do suffer from one, or a combination of the conditions outlined by the applicants. If a claimant believes that his or her personal circumstances require than an exception be made for him or her from the standard practice of questioning in the hearing, the respondent says, the claimant may file a motion setting out the specific reason why an exemption from the standard practice should be provided.

If I am wrong in that regard, I would conclude that fundamental justice does not require that the questioning order employed in the civil and criminal courts be extended to refugee determination hearings. That procedural order was developed in the context of adversarial proceedings and strict rules of evidence in which the role of the Court was to oversee the contest between the parties, decide issues of law and instruct a jury, if sitting with one, or itself, if sitting alone, to find the facts and apply the law within the narrow confines of the pleadings or indictment.", "104": "[104]\nIn\nBaker\n, above, at paragraph 26, Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 noted that the doctrine of legitimate expectation is based on the principle that the \"circumstances\" affecting procedural fairness take into account the promises or regular practices of administrative decision-makers, and that it will generally be unfair for them to act in contravention of representations as to procedure, or to backtrack on substantive promises without according significant procedural rights.

The respondent takes the position, however, that there is no need for the Court to determine this matter on fundamental justice considerations as this case may be resolved through the application of administrative law principles respecting natural justice.", "130": "[130]\nAt the trial level, the Court in\nAinsley\nfound the statement to be mandatory and regulatory in nature based on three factors: (1) the language of the policy; (2) the practical effect of failing to comply with the policy; and (3) the evidence with respect to the expectations of the Commission and staff regarding the implementation of the policy: see\nAinsley Financial Corp. et al. v. Ontario Securities Commission et al.\n(1993), 14 O.R.(3d) 280; 106 D.L.R.(4th) 507 (Gen. Div.).", "237": "[237]\nBased on the analysis above I make the following findings on each of the issues.\n- Although the order of questioning in refugee determination proceedings engages the security of the person interests of claimants, this case concerns classic administrative law issues that may be determined under the principles of natural justice and fairness without invoking the\nCharter\n. It is therefore not necessary for the Court to determine the scope and effect of fundamental justice under s. 7 with regard to the application of the Guideline. In the alternative, if a\nCharter\nanalysis is required, fundamental justice does not require that the questioning order employed in the civil and criminal courts be extended to refugee determination hearings. The legislative intention to avoid the formalities attendant upon court proceedings is not inconsistent with the requirements of fundamental justice\n- After considering the factors laid out by the Supreme Court in\nBaker\nand the further factors submitted by the applicants, it has not been established that natural justice requires that counsel for a refugee claimant be provided with the opportunity to question the claimant first. The opportunity for the applicant to make written submissions and provide evidence to the Board, to have an oral hearing with the participation of counsel, and to make oral submissions, satisfies the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness and Guideline 7 does not, in itself, breach that duty.\n- While the language of Guideline 7 could be construed as mandatory in nature by inexperienced and less confident Board members, and although members may feel some top-down pressure to follow it, this does not lead to the conclusion that members consider themselves bound to apply the Guideline as if it were legislation, a regulation or a formal rule made under the Chairperson's authority. On the face of the record in this case, the evidence does not support a finding of fettering. Although fettering could be established in a particular case, the application of Guideline 7 in itself, does not fetter the discretion of Board members. Whether fettering has occurred must be established on a case-by-case basis.\n- Administrative tribunals are free, within reason, to determine their own procedures as they are \"masters in their own house\" with respect to internal administrative procedures, subject to the proviso that they comply with the duty of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice. The Chairperson's authority to make guidelines is broad enough to encompass the adoption of a procedure such as the standard order of questioning contemplated by Guideline 7. As Guideline 7 does not constitute a mandatory pronouncement which fetters the members' discretion, it does not operate as a mandatory rule and as such remains within the Chairperson's authority.\n- A reasonable apprehension of institutional bias does not arise merely because Board members conduct the questioning of refugee claimants in the absence of a refugee protection officer or in advance of claimants' counsel. In the particular circumstances of an individual case, aggressive questioning by the member or the refugee protection officer may amount to a breach of fairness, but the question of bias in this context has to be raised on a case-by-case basis. Whether a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out is to be decided by the judge hearing the merits of the case.\n- The common law principle of waiver requires that an applicant must raise an allegation of bias or a violation of natural justice before the tribunal at the earliest practical opportunity. If counsel were of the view that the application of Guideline 7 in a particular case would result in a denial of their client's right to a fair hearing, the earliest practical opportunity to raise an objection and to seek an exception from the standard order of questioning would have been in advance of each scheduled hearing, in accordance with Rules 43 and 44, or orally, at the hearing itself. A failure to object at the hearing must be taken as an implied waiver of any perceived unfairness resulting from the application of the Guideline itself. If the objection was made in a timely manner at or before the hearing, the applicants are entitled to raise it as a ground for judicial review in their applications for leave. If the applicants failed to cite a denial of procedural fairness in their applications for leave, judicial review of the applications should be confined to the grounds on which leave was sought.\nCertified Questions", "235": "[235]\nIn view of the unsettled state of the law on these issues and that prior to\nThamotharem\nthis Court had consistently denied applications based solely on Guideline 7, applicants should not be penalized for the failure of counsel to specify the ground in the Notice of Application if it is clear from the materials filed with the application that procedural fairness was in issue. That is not to be taken as an invitation to expand the grounds for which leave has been granted. If the issue of Guideline 7 is only raised in a further memorandum of fact and law filed subsequent to the granting of leave, there has been an implied waiver and the applicants are restricted to the issues identified in the initial application and memorandum.", "121": "[121]\nAn additional factor raised in these proceedings is the perceived distortion of the role of the Board member. The function of making decisions on a daily basis that have profound implications for those appearing before them is very challenging. Guideline 7 adds to the burden of that task as members must often now take on a lead role in questioning where no RPO is present, which is increasingly common.", "137": "[137]\nContrary to what may have been suggested in\nJin\n, fettering was argued and considered in\nZaki\n, albeit without the extensive evidence and submissions that were before the Court in\nThamotharem\n. The Court concluded that fettering could not be established in a hypothetical context and that on the record there was no evidence to support such a finding. At paragraph 16 the Court stated that the Guideline:\n\"... incorporates a flexible approach to the use of the RPD-first order of questioning; there is no rigid rule that purports to bind the RPD. It is up to each panel to determine, upon application, what order of questioning will be used. Whether a claimant will be granted the right to proceed first will depend on the facts of each case.\"", "101": "[101]\nIn these proceedings, the Toronto-based applicants submit that they had a legitimate expectation that they would be allowed to question first because that was the general practice prior to the adoption of the Guideline, outside of hearings conducted in Montreal and Ottawa. With respect to the Montreal-based applicants, they submit that the practice in that city was to allow counsel to question first on request, and that the reason why this was not done as a general rule had more to do with the exigencies of the provincial legal aid tariff than any other reason.", "013": "[13]\nThe Chairperson's discretionary authority to issue guidelines to Board members is set out in\nIRPA\nparagraph 159(1)(h).

(\nRajaratnam\n), in which he observed that the Court was concerned \"that the Board Member, by her questioning, may have removed her judicial hat and put on the hat of an advocate\". This arose in the context of extensive questioning by the Member after the evidence of the claimant had already been elicited by counsel and the refugee hearing officer. Justice Stone referred to the principles respecting judicial intervention in hearings and concluded that the questioning had remained within the bounds of propriety.", "082": "[82]\nAs I read the Court's reasons, this decision does not stand for the proposition that the claimant's counsel must always question first but rather, whichever procedure is followed, that the claimant must be given fair notice of the issues and a fair opportunity to be heard.

The respondent asks the Court to conclude, on the basis of the fresh evidence before me, that the discretion of RPD members has not in fact been fettered by implementation of the Guideline. To the extent that any of the applicants perceive that the application of the Guideline has denied them a fair hearing, the respondent submits that they may seek a remedy in this Court, as they have, and that each case of alleged procedural unfairness should be reviewed on an individual basis.", "151": "[151]\nIn exhibits A-8 and A-9, the Member does not consider the particular circumstances of the claimant before him but addresses the validity of the Guideline in general. Although it is not clear from his reasons whether the Member considered whether the applicant before him fell within the paragraph 23 examples, a review of the Tribunal Record for each of these cases (which are part of the consolidated action) shows that the applicant's counsel in each case did not raise a specific objection to the implementation of Guideline 7 based on the circumstances of the particular claimant. Counsel raised only a general objection to the Guideline without stating why the claimant should be questioned by counsel first.", "070": "[70]\nIn\nMacKay et al. v.

This interpretation of the enactment, I was advised during oral argument, is based on the fact that there is no comma before the word \"and\" in the English version. I am not persuaded that is the correct interpretation. As noted in Sullivan and Driedger on the\nConstruction of Statutes\n, 4th Ed. 2002, at 312-314, punctuation may be of assistance in cases of ambiguity but Canadian courts have been reluctant to place much reliance on it as an aid to interpretation due to its inherent unreliability.", "148": "[148]\nIn exhibit A-1, counsel objected to the Guideline on the basis that it violates natural justice.

His analysis of the fourth factor dealing with legitimate expectation and the fifth concerning the ability of the tribunal to control its own process pointed to a lesser standard. With regard to the importance of the decision to the individual affected, the third factor, I agree with Justice Blanchard that as the security interests of the claimants are engaged and will be determined by the Board's decision, this indicates that a higher degree of procedural fairness is required.", "066": "[66]\nWhat constitutes a \"reasonable opportunity to present evidence\" must depend upon the circumstances of each case. It may be that in a particular refugee determination hearing it would be necessary for the claimant's counsel to question first in order to ensure that his or her evidence is properly presented. But I have difficulty understanding why that would be necessary in every case or why it is essential in fundamental justice terms that the claimant have the option at his or her discretion to determine the order of questioning, as the applicants have argued.", "200": "[200]\nThe circumstances surrounding the Board's adoption of the standard order of questioning do not, in my view, compare with those in\nKozak\n. There is no suggestion that any improper influence was brought to bear on the outcome of the decisions rendered by the RPD members who applied the Guideline or that the application of the Guideline was intended to have any effect on the results of the claims. Indeed, the uncontradicted evidence is that the claim acceptance rate has not varied for the periods before and after the adoption of the Guideline.", "043": "[43]\nIn applications for judicial review of the actions of administrative tribunals, the starting point is usually to determine the standard of review on a pragmatic and functional analysis.

Members were invited to self-report on their use of the guidelines. Paul Aterman's evidence was that the response rate on these forms was very low. Thus it is difficult to understand how that might be perceived as coercive. At most, this would seem to be a normal and unthreatening procedure to gauge the effects of a policy.", "020": "[20]\nPaul Aterman's affidavits describe the purpose of these guidelines from the Board's perspective. He says that they are issued to address specific legal issues, to provide guidance on questions of mixed law and fact, to codify the exercise of discretion, and to provide guidance on procedural issues. The intent is to promote consistency, coherence and fairness in the treatment of cases at the Board. They are not viewed as binding. Members are advised to use their discretion to follow a different approach where warranted in individual cases. These views are also set out in a statement entitled \"Policy on the use of the Chairperson's Guidelines\" attached as Exhibit \"J\" to the second Aterman affidavit.", "192": "[192]\nIn my view, the question of the independence of the IRB is not squarely raised in these proceedings on the records before me and I do not intend to attempt to decide that question.

Those are discretionary choices which the guideline makes clear are open to members ...\"", "002": "[2]\nThis guideline, entitled \"Guideline 7 - Concerning Preparation and Conduct of a Hearing in the Refugee Protection Division\", was the subject of a recent decision of Justice Edmond P.

In reasons dated January 6, 2006, Justice Blanchard found that Guideline 7 unlawfully fettered the discretion of members of the Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\") and held that the decision that was before him would be quashed and the applicant's claim remitted for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. In an Order dated January 19, 2006, Justice Blanchard allowed the application and certified three questions as being of general importance in accordance paragraph 74(d) of\nIRPA\n.

A similar result occurred in A-7.", "110": "[110]\nThe applicants submit, nonetheless, that for the purpose of the\nBaker\nanalysis in this case, it is necessary to consider whether the evidence supports the conclusion that the order of questioning adopted by the Board does in fact improve its efficiency or, put another way, whether counsel-first questioning would be an impediment to hearing efficiency. They suggest that was not considered in\nThamotharem\nand invite the Court in these proceedings to arrive at a different conclusion of the weight to be afforded this factor. The applicants point to the concession of Mr. Aterman on cross-examination that there is no evidence that the implementation of the Guideline order of questioning has, in itself, had any impact on increasing the efficiency of refugee hearings.", "048": "[48]\nI note that in\nThamotharem\n, neither the applicant nor the intervener argued that the Chairperson's standard order of questioning procedure violates the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed under s. 7 of the\nCharter\n. Rather, they based their submissions on the common law principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Accordingly, Justice Blanchard determined the content of the procedural protections to be afforded the applicant in that case by an analysis of the factors described by Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 in\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22; 174 D.L.R.(4th) 193 (\nBaker\n).

Similarly in\nSandor\n, the Court found that extensive questioning by a Board member constituted a breach of natural justice and the denial of the right to a fair hearing. But these decisions do not support the proposition that a change in the order of questioning in itself gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.", "185": "[185]\nNo doubt the guideline route is easier to follow as it avoids the hurdles and delays that accompany the making of delegated legislation such as regulations and rules. That process also exposes proposals to greater scrutiny and may well result in revisions or changes before formal approval is granted. It may well be preferable that a significant change of procedure before the Board should be implemented through a change to the\nRules\nas opposed to a guideline. However, I am not persuaded that the Chairperson's authority to make guidelines is not broad enough to encompass the adoption of a procedure such as the standard order of questioning contemplated by Guideline 7.", "053": "[53]\nI have some difficulty with the notion that the rights at issue in these proceedings are those of counsel. This may have been just a matter of unfortunate phrasing but a recurring theme throughout the oral argument was that what upset counsel most was the loss of control over the presentation of the claimant's case in the hearing setting.", "155": "[155]\nIn Exhibit B-7, while the Member refers to \"exceptional circumstances\" she accedes to a request to change the order of questioning because counsel indicated that the claimant, an 18 year old Iranian national, was accustomed to different institutions \"... and because counsel was Iranian and knowledgeable of Iranian culture ...\".", "172": "[172]\nThat is not to say that fettering could not be made out in a particular case. As held in\nSo v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (Ont.)\n(1995), 82 O.A.C. 43; 24 O.R.(3d) 530 (Div. Ct.), the application of a policy guideline may amount to an unlawful fettering of a Board's discretion, if applied without due consideration to the evidence and submissions in a particular case. Such a situation may arise where a member decides to apply the Guideline without exception and ignores the evidence or submissions of counsel that there is reason to vary the procedure.\nIs Guideline 7 beyond the scope of the Chairperson's authority?", "085": "[85]\nAs noted above, the factors to be considered in determining whether the common law duty of fairness has been met by the procedures in question were discussed by Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 in\nBaker\n, above, at paragraphs 22-28.

Justice MacGuigan noted:\n\"\nThe only reasonable course of conduct for a party reasonably apprehensive of bias would be to allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity.\nHere, AECL called witnesses, cross-examined the witnesses called by the Commission, made many submissions to the Tribunal, and took proceedings before both the Trial Division and this Court, all without challenge to the independence of the Commission. In short, it ... impliedly ... waived its right to object.\" (Emphasis added)", "049": "[49]\nAs held in\nSingh\n, the\nCharter\nprotects the personal security interests of\nConvention\nrefugee status claimants. Those interests are engaged by the risk of being returned to persecution and claimants are thus entitled to fundamental justice in the determination of their status. \"Fundamental justice\", as used in\nCharter\ns. 7, is broader than the administrative law concept of natural justice. It encompasses substantive as well as procedural elements. At a minimum, fundamental justice in the refugee determination context requires that claimants are provided with an adequate opportunity to state their case and to know the case they have to meet. In\nSingh\n, the Supreme Court found that this requires notice and an oral hearing, although how that hearing was to be conducted was not specified.", "161": "[161]\nMr. Aterman also expressed the view on cross-examination that members exercise their judgment with respect to how and when to apply the Guideline bearing in mind the particular circumstances of any given case (September 15, 2006 transcript at 79-80). Those comments are supported by the examples of decisions deviating from the Guideline that are attached to the Kiyani affidavit.", "220": "[220]\nFrom the above discussion, I would take the principle that an applicant must raise an allegation of bias or other violation of natural justice before the tribunal at the earliest practical opportunity. The earliest practical opportunity arises when the applicant is aware of the relevant information and it is reasonable to expect him or her to raise an objection.", "106": "[106]\nIn each of these cases, the question of legitimate expectation arose in the context of representations made or alleged to have been made directly to the party seeking to rely on the doctrine. For example in\nQi\n, the applicant had been invited to have counsel present at her interview but counsel was then denied an opportunity to take part in the process. In\nMercier-N\u00e9ron\n, a hearing was offered and then withdrawn.

As I read the jurisprudence, waiver will not be implied where the party against whom it is claimed has made an objection to the procedure before or during the hearing itself.

This action was cited by the applicants as illustrating the Board's efforts to impose Guideline 7 on the RPD members and thereby fetter their discretion. However, the distribution of the decision is not in my view evidence of fettering so long as members did not consider themselves bound to follow Member Brennenstuhl's conclusions. There is no evidence before me that this was the case. The\nR.K.N.\ndecision has not been identified by the Chairperson as a jurisprudential guide nor does it fall within the category of \"persuasive decision\", which the Deputy Chair, Refugee Protection Division may designate under a policy adopted by the Board as \"models of sound reasoning\" which members are encouraged to adopt.

The object is not to try to \"win\" a case.", "180": "[180]\nAs the applicants' argument goes, an examination of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n(\"the\nRules\n\") supports this interpretation. The\nRules\nclearly and exhaustively set out the procedure to be followed by the RPD.

This argument is advanced on a hypothetical and theoretical basis without reference to a factual foundation other than that revealed by the Guideline 7 documentation filed in these proceedings.", "091": "[91]\nThe respondent acknowledges that the lack of a right to appeal a negative refugee decision is a factor to be considered in ascertaining the content of procedural fairness in refugee hearings as per the second branch of the\nBaker\ntest. The respondent submits, however, that issues concerning the RAD are separate and distinct from the Guideline 7 issues that are properly before this Court.", "212": "[212]\nAs observed by the Federal Court of Appeal in\nKozak\n, above at paragraph 66, parties are not normally able to complain of a breach of a duty of procedural fairness by an administrative tribunal if they did not raise it at the earliest reasonable moment.", "146": "[146]\nWhile the attachments to the Kiyani affidavit provide only a selective picture of the response of Board members to Guideline 7, they support the respondent's contention that the discretion of Board members is not fettered by Guideline 7 and that members are not restricting themselves to the exceptional examples set out in paragraph 23 of Guideline 7 as an exhaustive list of instances in which the order of questioning should be varied as Justice Blanchard feared.", "030": "[30]\nIt appears from the evidence, and submissions of counsel, that prior to the implementation of Guideline 7, it was common in Toronto, and possibly Calgary and Vancouver, although the evidence with respect to those cities is not clear, for counsel for the claimant to begin the questioning at the hearings. The RPO (if present) would then question the claimant, followed by the Board member if he or she had any remaining matters to raise. This practice, the applicants submit, was more in keeping with the nature of a quasi-judicial hearing and allowed for an \"examination-in-chief\" in which claimants were encouraged to fully recount their histories with the assistance of counsel whom they had come to know and trust.", "060": "[60]\nThe applicants seek to elevate the issue of the order of questioning in refugee determination proceedings to a level where constitutional protection would be required and appropriate. While it is an important issue in light of the security of the person interests that are affected by the fairness of the refugee determination process, I am satisfied that this case concerns classic administrative law issues that may be determined under the principles of natural justice and fairness without invoking the\nCharter\n. As noted in\nSuresh\n, the principles underlying the duty of fairness are the same as those of which s. 7 speaks in the procedural context. This controversy can be properly dealt with on the basis of the procedural protections reflected in the common law doctrine of fairness.", "153": "[153]\nThere are several decisions in which counsel submitted evidence of pyschological or emotional fraility, or the Board was otherwise aware of the condition, and the Member allowed the order of questioning to be reversed: B-2, B-3, B-5, B-8, B-11, B-12, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-6. In others, a RPO was not present at the hearing and the Member opted to have counsel question first: B-9, C-9, C-15.", "131": "[131]\nIn upholding that decision, the Court of Appeal held that the two factors of particular importance in determining whether a guideline has \"crossed the Rubicon\" dividing the not always clear line between guideline and regulation are the language of the statement and the threat of coercive action.

Further, they submit, the filing of the PIF and the presentation of the claimant's narrative in written form does not mitigate the need for an examination-in-chief. This is particularly so because of the central role that credibility determinations play in refugee proceedings.

One example of the documentary evidence was the Research Directorate's Issue Paper\nUkraine: Situation of Jews\n, dated January 1999, which suggests that it might be easier for Ukrainian citizens to get legal redress in Kiev than in provincial towns and cities. Other documentary evidence referred to the fact that the Ukrainian government is committed to fighting anti-Semitism and that the Jewish population has enjoyed increasing opportunities for religious and cultural expression since Ukrainian independence.

I do not view the Board's statement regarding limited resources as an acknowledgement that state protection is as unavailable in Kiev as in the Applicant's village.

Minister of National Revenue, 70 D.T.C. 6351), a decision of Jackett, P., in the Exchequer Court, which was also referred to in the Bronfman Trust case (supra) and summarized as follows, at page 5062:\n\"In that case the taxpayer corporation wanted to raise capital by way of bond issues for expansion of its business. It discovered, however, that it was impossible, practically speaking, to float a bond issue unless it first redeemed its preferred shares, because of the sinking fund requirements of its preferred share issue. Accordingly, the taxpayer borrowed $700,000, used $400,000 to redeem the preferred shares and the remaining $300,000 for expansion of its business. Jackett, P., held that interest payments on the entire $700,000 loan deductible.\nHe saw the borrowed funds as 'fill[ing] the hole left by the redemption'.\n\" (Emphasis added)", "012": "[12]\nIn light of the Bronfman Trust decision, it would seem to me that one cannot infer from the Trans-Prairie case that interest on borrowed money used to redeem shares is\ngenerally\ndeductible.", "004": "[4]\nThe plaintiff's view is that the entire amount of interest expense deducted by Inter-Import in the 1983 taxation year was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property and accordingly, Inter-Import was entitled to deduct the full amount of interest paid in respect of the borrowed funds in computing its income for the 1983 taxation year.", "001": "[1]\nPinard, J.\n: This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the reassessment made by the Minister of National Revenue, which served to deny International-Import Customs Brokers Inc. the right to deduct pursuant to s. 20(1)(c)(i) of the Income Tax Act, S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63, as amended, the full amount of interest paid by the latter in respect of borrowed money in computing its income for the 1983 taxation year.", "003": "[3]\nThis litigation thus involves Inter-Import's right to deduct the full amount of interest paid in respect of the said borrowed funds in computing its income for the 1983 taxation year, pursuant to s. 20(1)(c)(i) of the Act.", "007": "[7]\nChief Justice Dickson went on to emphasize the necessity to look at the direct use to which a taxpayer puts borrowed money, reaffirming the reluctance of the Supreme Court of Canada to overlook a clearly ineligible direct use of borrowed money whenever an indirect eligible use of funds can be found. In that regard, at pages 5065 and 5066, he stated the following:\n\"In my view, neither the Income Tax Act nor the weight of judicial authority permits the courts to ignore the direct use to which a taxpayer puts borrowed money. ...\n\"One finds in the Act not only the distinction within s. 20(1)(c)(i) between eligible and ineligible uses of funds, but other provisions which also require the tracing of funds to particular uses in a manner inconsistent with the argument of the Trust. Section 20(3) (formerly s. 11(3b)) stipulates, for example, that interest on money borrowed to repay an existing loan shall be deemed to have been used for the purpose for which the previous borrowings were used. This provision would, of course, be unnecessary if interest on borrowed money were deductible when the taxpayer had income-earning properties to preserve. On the contrary, however, for taxation years prior to the enactment of s. 11(3b) in S.C. 1953-54, c. 57, s. 2(6), it had been held that such interest was not deductible since the borrowings were used to repay a loan and not to earn income: Interior Breweries Ltd. v. M.N.R., 55 D.T.C. 1090 at p. 1093 (Exch. Ct.).\n\"It is not surprising, therefore, that the cases interpreting s. 20(1)(c)(i) and its predecessor provisions have not favoured the view that a direct ineligible use of borrowed money ought to be overlooked whenever an indirect eligible use of funds can be found. ...\n\"The leading case from this court on the availability of the interest \u00a0deduction, Canada Safeway Ltd. v. M.N.R., also demonstrates a reluctance to overlook a clearly ineligible direct use of borrowed money in order to favour the taxpayer by characterizing the transaction on the basis of a less direct eligible use of borrowings. ... Justice Rand stated, at p. 726:\n'No doubt there is in fact a causal connection between the purchase of the stock and the benefits ultimately received; but the statutory language cannot be extended to such a remote consequence; it could be carried to any length in a chain of subsidiaries; and to say that such a thing was envisaged by the ordinary expression used in the statute is to speculate and to interpret.'\n\"Referring to the interest expense deduction for borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from business, Rand, J., concluded at p. 727:\n'What is aimed at by the section is an employment of the borrowed funds immediately within the company's business and not one that effects its purpose in such an indirect and remote manner.'\""}, "decision": "Based on the foregoing, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, except in exceptional cases, s. 20(1)(c) of the\nAct\nrequires that the use of borrowed money be traced to a specific eligible use, and that it be demonstrated that the borrowed funds are used directly and immediately to earn income from a business or property"}, "449": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nLikewise, in\nMooker et al. v.

Justice von Finckenstein held at paragraph 18:\n\"Such a procedure totally fails to take into account the pain, dislocation and emotional toil entailed in any removal.

Accordingly, it was reasonably open to the immigration officer to decide that the applicants would not face \"unusual or disproportionate hardship\" compared to all Indo-Guyanese sent home from Canada after a failed refugee claim. An H&C finding otherwise, would \"open the floodgates\" as submitted by the respondent, in that all Indo-Guyanese would overstay their legal status in Canada, and file an H&C application on the basis that they face a likelihood of \"hardship\" if returned to their home country due to the prevalence of crime against the Indo-Guyanese in Guyana.\nIssue No. 3: Were the PRRA officer's findings relating to establishment in Canada reasonable?", "018": "[18]\nAccordingly, a failed refugee claimant who does not leave Canada for a number of years, as the applicants did not, do so knowing their removal will be more painful when the time comes. The applicants overstayed their legal entitlement to remain in Canada. The fact that they have spent a number of years in Canada, does not entitle them to an H&C exemption from having to apply from outside of Canada for permanent residence in Canada.\nIssue No. 1: Did the PRRA officer incorrectly find that the applicants' could apply from abroad for permanent resident status under the family class without any \"apparent obstacles\"?", "040": "[40]\nIt may be an \"unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship\" for the applicants to return to Guyana pending processing of the sponsorship application by the daughter due to the delay of the respondent's Mississauga office caused by the lack of bureaucratic resources. In other words, it may be a \"disproportionate hardship\" for the applicants to give up their house, give up their jobs, give up their Canadian community and resettle in Guyana, all for a period of time which may be a matter of months, or possibly one or two years, while the respondent's bureaucracy processes their application. The respondent can quickly and easily determine, on a \"paper screening basis\", whether the sponsorship application will likely be approved, and if on a \"paper screening\" it is likely that the sponsorship application will be approved, then the H&C officer may decide that it is an \"unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship\" for the applicants to have to uproot themselves from Canada only to return to Canada again soon thereafter.", "045": "[45]\nBoth parties advised the Court that they do not consider that this case raises a serious question which ought to be certified for an appeal. The Court agrees.\nJUDGMENT", "042": "[42]\nThe same rationale applies to the sponsorship of the applicant by their daughter. Perhaps this is a consideration for a removal officer who is being asked to defer removal. Perhaps it is a legitimate consideration for an H&C officer. In any event, it is important that the right hand of the respondent know what the left hand is doing. Since this issue has come before an H&C officer for decision, it is incumbent upon the H&C officer to take into account the status and likelihood of success of the daughter's sponsorship application of the applicant to ensure that the respondent does not impose an unnecessary hardship on the applicants by deporting them one month only to tell the applicants they can come back to Canada as permanent residents a few months later.", "024": "[24]\nThe applicants submit that the PRRA officer erred by applying the wrong test in assessing the applicant's risk and \"hardship\". Specifically, the applicants submit that the PRRA officer's finding that the applicants had not established a personalized risk and \"hardship\" demonstrates that the officer assessed the risk on a PRRA standard, rather than an H&C standard.", "019": "[19]\nThe applicants are currently the subject of an application by their daughter to sponsor them as members of the family class. This sponsorship application was filed over 1 year ago, and acknowledged by the respondent on April 24, 2008. The respondent advised the daughter that sponsorship applications for parents \"are experiencing longer processing times\", i.e. do not expect an answer soon. The PRRA officer stated in his decision (at p. 2c of the Application Record):\n\"It is understandable that the applicant[s] would want to remain in Canada with their extended family considering they have been together since they last travelled to Canada ... However, I note the purpose of H&C discretion is to allow flexibility to approve deserving cases not anticipated in the legislation. I have to look to the possibility of reunification through an existing program such as the family class program which exists for cases such as the one before me. I find there are no apparent obstacles that would impede an overseas sponsorship.\"", "022": "[22]\nHere, the PRRA officer found, in considering the applicants' family ties, that the hardship of separation from their extended family in Canada would not amount to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship and that the applicants' also had extended family in Guyana to help and support them. Moreover, while considering the best interest of the child, the PRRA officer found that the minor applicant would be able to readjust to life in Guyana because his parents would be with him to offer love and support. Thus, unlike in the cases cited by the applicant, the PRRA officer's finding did not hinge in this case on an assumption that the applicants would certainly be able to return as members of the family class. There is no indication that, if the PRRA officer thought the applicants may not be able to return, he would find the requisite hardship had been established. In fact, the decision quite clearly states that the hardships that would be faced by the applicants upon removal are not at the level that warrants an H&C exemption. For this reason, the PRRA officer's statement that the applicants could apply from overseas for family class status without any \"apparent obstacles\" is not an error that warrants setting aside the decision.", "029": "[29]\nThe applicants also submit that, contrary to the statements of the PRRA officer, H&C applicants are not required to show that state protection is not available in order to establish hardship sufficient to warrant an H&C exemption.

The purpose of s. 52 of\nIRPA\nis to provide individuals under a removal order with a strong incentive to comply. Individuals who remain in Canada following a deportation order face the risk of having to apply for an ARC if they wish to return to Canada. This is not unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\nIssue No. 2: Did the PRRA officer err in assessing the applicants' claims relating to risk?", "014": "[14]\nAccordingly, the fact that applicants have been in Canada for a number of years is not a basis for allowing applicants to apply for landing from within Canada on an H&C basis, instead of returning home and joining \"a long queue in which many others have been waiting patiently\".", "044": "[44]\nAccordingly, the likelihood of being a victim of crime in Guyana by itself, is not a \"hardship\" for the purpose of an H&C application unless it is combined, as it is in the case of the applicants, with a timely sponsorship by the daughter, which, on a quick \"paper screen\", the respondent could determine whether the applicants will probably be legally entitled to permanent residence status in Canada. In such a case, it may be \"unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship\" for the applicants to be returned to Guyana, required to resettle in Guyana with the real possibility of being victimized by criminals, only then to be told after one or two more years that they can return to Canada as permanent residents. That disruption, caused by understandable bureaucratic delays in the processing of the sponsorship application, could be found by the immigration officer to constitute \"unusual, underserved or disproportionate hardship\" for the purpose of their H&C application. The overlay of the sponsorship application, with a paper screen analysis by the respondent as to its likelihood of success, is what separates the applicants' situation from other Indo-Guyenese with an H&C application who have to return to Guyana after losing their refugee claim and PRRA.\nNo certified question", "005": "[5]\nThe PRRA officer found that the applicants' personal circumstances did not establish that the hardship of being refused the H&C exemption would cause them unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The PRRA officer found:\na. The risks alleged by the applicant were not personalized and state protection was available. The applicants stated that they feared crime, violence and racial tension and feared that they would be targeted as returnees. The PRRA officer stated that \"everyone in Guyana is subject to these conditions\" and the risk to the applicants did not meet the level of hardship warranting an H&C exemption (p. 2b);\nb. The applicants were not established in Canada \"beyond the normal establishment that one would expect the applicants to have achieved in the circumstances\" (p. 2b). The PRRA officer acknowledged that the adult applicants were employed; that the applicants attended a Hindu temple and volunteered for certain organizations; and had provided reference letters from friends; but found that these facts did not go beyond the ordinary level of establishment. The PRRA officer also acknowledged that the applicants had purchased a home in Canada but stated that the house was purchased when the applicants' immigration status was not legal or was undecided and they were aware that they could be removed from Canada;\nc. The PRRA officer acknowledged that, in addition to the adult applicants' daughter having established permanent residence in Canada, the applicants had extended family in Canada including the female applicant's mother and sister, both Canadian citizens; the adult male applicant's sister, a Canadian citizen; and a number of aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins. However, the PRRA officer found that there were no obstacles to the applicants applying as immigrants under the family class program and that family reunification, while a goal of the immigration system, was not the purpose of an H&C exemption. The PRRA officer also noted that the male applicant's extended family resides in Guyana and could provide support to the applicants (p. 2c);\nd. The applicants' prolonged stay in Canada was not due to circumstances beyond their control. The conditional departure order was issued when the applicants' refugee claim was rejected on March 23, 2003 and the applicants have remained in Canada for another six years of their own will (p. 2c); and\ne. The best interests of the minor child did not require that he remain in Canada. The child, Davendra, was 9 years old when the applicants came to Canada and is now 15 years old. The PRRA officer found that as Davendra had lived in Guyana for a major part of his young life, attended school there, speakes the language and is familiar with the customs, he would not have significant difficulty re-adapting to life there, particularly given his ability to adapt to life in Canada. The PRRA officer stated that the minor applicant would have his parents to assist him in this transition (p. 2c).", "026": "[26]\nIn\nBarrak et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(2008), 333 F.T.R. 109; 2008 FC 962, however, Mr. Justice de Montigny found at paragraph 32-34:\n\"\n\u00b632\nWhile the officer was entitled to rely on the same facts for the PRRA and the H&C assessments, she was required to apply the test of unusual and undeserved or disproportional hardship to those facts, a lower threshold than the test of risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment relevant to a PRRA decision ...\n\"\n\u00b634\n... The officer may well have dealt with the main applicant's fear of arrest, of torture, of being killed or beaten, or with the religious intolerance towards Christian Maronites. But she did not explain why these fears fall short of amounting to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, even if they do not rise to the threshold of personalized risk to the applicants. There being no certainty that the result of her analysis would have been the same had she applied her mind to the proper test, the file must be returned for a new determination.\"", "021": "[21]\nThe applicants rely on a number of cases to support their submission that an incorrect assumption that a claimant can return to return to Canada by way of another application is sufficient to set aside an H&C decision:\nArulraj v.

In the first three of these cases, the relevant issue was the best interests of the children and the hardship caused by the separation of a child from a parent who was being removed from Canada. In these cases, the H&C officers found that the hardship to the claimants was limited because the separation from the parent was only temporary. The facts in\nRaposo\nwere similar, except that the case involved the separation of children from their grandparents. Had there been a chance that the separation from the parent would be lengthy or permanent, it was clear that the H&C officers would have found the separation adversely affected the best interests of the child.", "032": "[32]\nThe applicants submit that they have an exceptionally high degree of establishment in Canada and that the PRRA officer's finding that their establishment was \"nothing beyond the normal establishment that one would expect\" was unreasonable.

His family ties with his sisters and their families in Canada, which have apparently meant much to him in his rehabilitation from alcohol addiction and from incarceration, will be strained. He currently has regular employment in Canada and no job prospects if he is returned to Guyana. Nor does he have any immediate family there. It will be more difficult for him to communicate with counsel concerning his application for leave. Nevertheless, I do not believe these personal difficulties constitute irreparable harm, as serious as they may be for the applicant. He will not be returned to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy. If leave is granted on his application for judicial review, if the orders sought in that application are granted, and if the respondent on further review should determine that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for him to remain in Canada, the deportation order now outstanding and to be implemented on March 23, 1992, may also be questionable and it will not be beyond the imagination of the respondent to arrange to admit the applicant to Canada should he seek to return.", "010": "[10]\nOn the afternoon of February 27 counsel for the applicant was advised by telephone that the respondent's officer responsible had considered the written humanitarian and compassionate submissions filed on behalf of the applicant and had found there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to interfere with the deportation process.

In that telephone conversation counsel requested reasons or the basis for the finding of insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds and in response was given some suggested inadequacies, though the officer engaged in the telephone discussion was not the one responsible for the decision. In fact, the decision was made on February 21, was not communicated to the applicant in writing and was only communicated through counsel on February 27. Still seeking reasons for rejection of the applicant's submissions, counsel for the applicant spoke by telephone with staff of the officer responsible for the decision, found that that officer had been away from the office for approximately a week, and it was suggested that she direct inquiries to the assistant manager of the unit, apparently acting in place of the absent responsible officer. As suggested to her, counsel arranged for the applicant's file with written humanitarian and compassionate submissions to be forwarded to the assistant manager for review and the following afternoon, February 28, counsel was advised that the assistant manager had reviewed the file and submissions and was in agreement that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant interfering with the deportation process. Again, counsel sought reasons or the basis of the decision but none were provided in the telephone conversation. At the subsequent meeting on March 2, which the applicant attended with counsel, representatives of his family and his employer, no opportunity was provided for discussion of humanitarian and compassionate considerations and the meeting was concerned solely with arrangements for the applicant's departure from Canada.

While the filing of a caution on title may prevent or otherwise restrict the disposition of the property, it is far from certain that it constitutes a seizure. I do not believe that activities pursued by the Minister in accordance with the administrative enforcement mechanisms of a regulatory statute that effectively \"freeze\" a taxpayer's assets constitute a \"seizure\" in the sense required to bring these activities within the scrutiny of the standards set by the Supreme Court in\nHunter v.

The court (at p. 5058) found that the use of the term \"shall\" deprived the issuing officer of any residual discretion and for that reason alone the provision ran afoul of ss. 7 and 8 of the\nCharter\n. Important for our purposes is that unlike s. 225.2, the court found that s. 231.3 was concerned with the detection and prosecution of crime and, therefore, \"nothing less than the full panoply of\nCharter\nprotection is appropriate\".

The amount of money involved is not significant:\nwhat the Minister has to know is whether the taxpayer's assets can be liquidated in the meantime or be seized by other creditors and so not available to him\n.\n\"... In my opinion, this latitude allows the Minister to rely on the exceptional provisions contained in subsection 225.2(1)\nwhenever, on a balance of probability, the time allowed by the taxpayer by subsection 225.1(1) would jeopardize his debt\n. I emphasize on a balance of probability, not beyond all reasonable doubt. ...\n\"...

In\nLaframboise\n, Joyal, J., dealt with the taxpayer's argument that there were serious deficiencies in the affidavit evidence submitted on behalf of the Minister and the argument that evidence, when submitted in affidavit form, must be strictly construed.

As counsel for the Crown reminded me, however, I am entitled to look at all the evidence contained in the other affidavits.

As a result of the order, the Minister caused registrations to be made on the title of certain properties of the respondents. By notice of motion dated July 26, 1989 the applicant sought an order that, unless sufficient cause to the contrary be shown, the respondent Duncan's lands described in Instrument No. CT847090 registered in the Land Registry Office in Toronto be charged with the judgment in favour of the applicant in the amount of $517,456.47, together with interest as specified in the certificate dated July 18, 1989.

In\nSatellite Earth\n, MacKay, J., reviewed the factors to be considered by a court on a s. 225.2(8) review of a jeopardy collection order. After considering the case law dealing with the former version of s. 225.2 he concluded (at D.T.C. 5510) that in a s. 225.2(8) application the Minister has the ultimate burden of justifying the decision despite the fact that s. 225.2 as amended no longer includes the former paragraph (5) that specifically stated that \"on the hearing of an application under paragraph 2(c), the burden of justifying the decision is on the Minister\". However, the initial burden is on the taxpayer to show that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test has been met.\n\"In an application to review a 'jeopardy order' originally granted under paragraph 225.2(2) the issue will be whether that Order will now be set aside or varied. In this, an applicant under paragraph 225.2(8) has the initial burden to muster evidence, whether by affidavits, by cross-examination of affiants on behalf of the Crown, or both, that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test required by paragraph 225.2(2) has been met. Thus the ultimate burden on the Crown established by paragraph 225.2(2) continues when an order granted by the court is reviewed under paragraph 225.2(8).\n\"Occasionally there may be concern about whether the Order should have been made initially, but I expect that this will not often be the principal focus, unless there appears to have been a serious procedural flaw in the original application.\n\"... The evidence must be considered in relation to the test established by paragraph 225.2(2) itself and by relevant cases, that is, whether on a balance of probability the evidence leads to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection would be jeopardized by delay.\"", "017": "[17]\nThe constitutional validity of other sections of the\nIncome Tax Act\nrelated to administrative enforcement mechanisms has also been considered by this court. In\nMcLeod v. Minister of National Revenue et al.\n(1983), 146 D.L.R.(3d) 561 (F.C.T.D.), Dub\u00e9, J., determined that ss. 222, 223(2) and 158(1) of the\nIncome Tax Act\n, 1970-71-72, c. 63 [see footnote 2], were not contrary to s. 8 of the\nCharter\n. In that case there was no allegation that the collection proceedings were not carried out according to the provisions set out in the\nAct\n. However, the applicant in effect sought a declaration that these provisions were contrary to s. 8 of the\nCharter\n. Dub\u00e9, J., commented (at p. 564):\n\"The applicant offers no jurisprudence to support such a sweeping demand. The crux of his argument, as I understand it, is that the common shares in his company ought not to be seized pending his appeal as 'at the present time I am not in a position to provide payment of the assessed amounts'. This is surely not evidence of a breach of the applicant's rights to be secure against seizure.\n\"As I pointed out at the hearing, the\nIncome Tax Act\nis a rigorous document. Parliament has ruled that taxes be paid within 30 days from assessment, whether the taxpayer files an appeal or not. The obvious purpose of such an imposition is to prevent a massive wave of taxpayers' appeals launched for the sole purpose of delaying the payment of taxes.\"", "015": "[15]\nAfter carefully considering the extensive argument put forth by the parties I find that the\nCharter\nshould not form a part of the judgment in this matter for the following reasons. First, the parties acknowledge that the relevant sections of the\nIncome Tax Act\nare not under attack in this application and they cannot be attacked in a proceeding of this nature. In\nRothmans of Pall Mall Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue\n, [1976] 2 F.C. 512; 10 N.R. 153 (C.A.), at p. 515, Le Dain, J.A. (as he then was), on behalf of the court, held that \"under the\nRules\ndeclaratory relief cannot be sought by originating motion but only by an action\". More recently, in\nTurmel v. C.R.T.C.\n(1985), 16 C.R.R. 9 (F.C.T.D.), Dub\u00e9, J., explained this requirement (at p. 11):\n\"I appreciate that time was and still is of the essence ... but constitutional matters cannot be solved on such a summary proceeding. The solution is for the application to proceed by way of a declaratory action that would allow for pleadings and discovery. The court, apprised of all the relevant facts and with the benefit of legal arguments, would then be in a position to adjudge whether or not the equitable basis principle as interpreted by the court is now in violation of s. 15 of the\nCharter\n.\"", "010": "[10]\nThe respondents further submit that in this instance, the deprivation of their property by the Minister affects the respondents' right to life, liberty and security of the person contrary to s. 7 of the\nCharter\n. The \"freezing\" or \"seizure\" of their assets while facing serious criminal charges and other legal proceedings that may result in incarceration if unsuccessfully or inadequately defended, is an infringement of their s. 7\nCharter\nrights. In addition, the interference, authorized on an ex parte application, is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.", "008": "[8]\nThe issues may be summarized as follows:\n1. The application and effect of the\nCharter\nwith respect to the order dated July 18, 1989; and\n2. Has the test required by s. 225.2 of the\nIncome Tax Act\nbeen met.

Furthermore, they suggest that material facts were not disclosed and that misleading evidence was presented at the ex parte hearing. They suggest that Mr. Hale's affidavits intimate that they were selling or encumbering their assets in breach of the conditions of bail. They state that there was no evidence that they had disposed of or attempted to dispose of assets subsequent to the dates of the notices and that there is no evidence that they were attempting to avoid their tax obligations. Rather, the respondents state that assets were dealt with in the ordinary course of utilization and they submit that the applicant has failed to show that the collection of moneys owing for taxes would be \"jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof\".", "006": "[6]\nBy notice of motion dated August 18, 1989, the respondents apply pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the\nAct\nfor a review of the order of July 18, 1989 and, by supplementary notice of motion dated August 24, 1989, the respondent Duncan seeks inter alia to set aside the Charging Order to Show Cause dated July 27, 1989, on the basis that proper disclosure had not been made. They also allege that both s. 225.2 of the\nAct\nand the order and directions thereto are an unreasonable seizure contrary to s. 8 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Constitution Act, 1982\n(the \"\nCharter\n\"), that they deny the respondents' right to life, liberty and security of the person contrary to s. 7 of the\nCharter\n, and that they constitute cruel and unusual treatment or punishment contrary to s. 12 of the\nCharter\n.\nRelevant Statutory Provisions:", "020": "[20]\nIn reviewing the authorization granted under s. 225.2(2), it is necessary to consider whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by the delay in the collection thereof.

Canada (Deputy Attorney General) and Minister of National Revenue\n, [1986] D.T.C. 6518 at p. 6519; 7 F.T.R. 42; 2 C.T.C. 380 at p. 381 (F.C.T.D.), enunciated the test to be met with respect to the previous s. 225.2(1):\n\"... the issue is not whether the collection per se is in jeopardy but rather whether the actual jeopardy arises from the likely delay in the collection thereof.\"", "002": "[2]\nBy notices of assessment and reassessments dated June 15, 1989 the respondent Duncan was assessed and reassessed with respect to his 1985, 1986 and 1987 taxation years and the respondent Petroff was reassessed with respect to his 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 taxation years. This resulted in an unpaid income tax liability of $511,621.41 for the respondent Duncan and an unpaid income tax liability of $583,512.27 for the respondent Petroff.", "011": "[11]\nThe applicant submits, however, that an enactment that provides for a judicial prior authorization of a search does not necessarily offend s. 8 of the\nCharter\n. Furthermore, the applicant suggests that the only appropriate forum for constitutional challenges or declaratory judgments is that involving a trial and not a motion or summary proceeding. In any event, the applicant suggests that the respondents' arguments are misdirected in view of the fact that an order under s. 225.2 and the directions thereto do no constitute a \"seizure\" for the purposes of s. 8 of the\nCharter\n. Furthermore, s. 8 does not relate to real property rights and s. 7 does not extend to protect property and pure economic rights. Finally, the effect of s. 225.2 is not a punishment as that term is used in s. 12 of the\nCharter\n.\nHas The Test Required By S. 225.2\nOf The\nIncome Tax Act\nBeen Met?", "009": "[9]\nThe respondents submit that the ex parte order dated July 18, 1989 pursuant to s. 225.2(2) of the\nIncome Tax Act\nis contrary to ss. 7 and 8 of the\nCharter\nalthough they concede that the statutory provision itself is not under attack in this proceeding. They suggest, however, that the deficiencies contained in s. 225.2 can be \"read down\" for our present purposes and that the order should be measured against the statutory provisions as properly interpreted in accordance with the\nCharter\n. In the alternative, the respondents submit that the order constitutes an unreasonable seizure in that it does not comply with the stringent requirements for a reasonable search and seizure enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nSoutham Inc. v. Hunter\n, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; 55 N.R. 241; 55 A.R. 291; 9 C.R.R. 355; 14 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 41 C.R.(3d) 97; [1984] 6 W.W.R. 577; 33 Alta.

The order authorizing immediate collection action is an unreasonable seizure because it was made upon virtually no evidence or credibly-based probability that such actions were required to prevent evasion of the payment of the assessed taxes such as to prevail over the respondents' rights to be \"left alone\".", "012": "[12]\nThe essential elements of the respondents' arguments are summarized as follows. The respondents state that mortgages were placed or renewed on their real property in Canada and that assets were encumbered or sold only in an effort to raise funds to cover bail-related and living expenses and for no improper purpose. The respondents explained that in California they were required to satisfy the court that no drug-related funds were used as bail, so mortgage funds were obtained.", "028": "[28]\nIn the present case the concern expressed by the Minister was that there has been substantial income and that the income was drug-related.

On the balance of probabilities, delay may jeopardize the collection of the taxpayers' tax debt.", "030": "[30]\nAccordingly, I conclude that the level of disclosure by the Minister was adequate, particularly since nothing was taken from the taxpayers until they had been notified of these registrations on title by the Minister.\nConclusion:", "004": "[4]\nBy originating notice of motion dated July 17, 1989 the applicant made an ex parte motion pursuant to s. 225.2(2) of the\nIncome Tax Act\non July 1989 for an order authorizing the Minister to proceed without delay on collection proceedings with respect to the respondents' tax debt. Upon hearing counsel for the applicant and upon reading the affidavits of Terry Hale, Chief of Collections, Mississauga District Office of Revenue Canada, sworn July 14 and July 18, 1989, by order dated July 18, 1989 I authorized the Minister to take forthwith any of the actions described in ss. 225.1(a) to (g) of the\nIncome Tax Act\n. I also directed that service of the order be effected by sending a photostatic copy to the respondents by registered mail on or before July 21, 1989.", "025": "[25]\nNor can I overlook the fact that the provision as it now stands has a greater safeguard than its predecessor. Under the\nIncome Tax Act\nas amended, ss. 222 to 228 set out a variety of procedures for the collection of moneys owed to Her Majesty for taxes, interest, penalties or other charges under the\nAct\n. In 1985 the\nAct\nwas amended and s. 225.1 was added to postpone these collection processes during the time allowed for a taxpayer to file a notice of objection with respect to the assessment or reassessment of his taxes. However, in exceptional circumstances where \"it could reasonably be considered that collection of an amount assessed would be prejudiced by the delay\", the Minister under the former s. 225.2 could institute collection proceedings. In 1988, the provisions were once again revised and s. 225.2 was amended to require prior authorization by a court before \"jeopardy collection\" procedures could be initiated. Although previously not required, the present provision requires the Minister to appear in court to avail himself of these special collection provisions if he wishes to do so before the period for filing notices of objection has expired.", "001": "[1]\nJerome, A.C.J.\n: The respondents' applications by way of originating notice of motion for a review, pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the\nIncome Tax Act\n, of my order dated July 18, 1989 were held together at Toronto, Ontario on January 15, 1990, January 19, 1990 and on April 2, 1990. The order, commonly referred to as a \"jeopardy collection order\", was granted on an ex parte application pursuant to s. 225.2(2) and authorized the Minister of National Revenue (the \"Minister\") to forthwith take any of the collection actions described in ss. 225.1(1)(a) to (g) of the\nIncome Tax Act\nwith respect to the respondents' tax debt.

The Queen\n, an unreported decision of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Eberle, J., expressed similar concerns:\n\"The notice of motion attacks s. 225.2 of the\nIncome Tax Act\n. I believe that it is misdirected. That section does not provide for anything even resembling a seizure of the money, nor even for the institution of collection procedures. It provides only for a decision of the Minister to override the 90 day delay of collection procedures imposed by s. 225.1. As a result of the decision taken under s. 225.2, it only becomes open to the Minister to take immediate collection actions as authorized elsewhere in the\nAct\n, if he so desires.\n\"Thus, [the] attack on s. 225.2 is in my view quite misdirected and fails because of its misconception of what that section does. In spite of that conclusion, it is evident that the applicant really seeks to attack the collection powers statutorily given to the Minister by ss. 222, 223 and 224 of the\nAct\n.\"", "003": "[3]\nOn February 11, 1988 the respondents were apprehended in the United States of America and charged with drug trafficking offenses.

I agree with this characterization of a band's custom. However, determining what is generally acceptable to members of the band gives rise to difficulties, as is exemplified by this litigation. Justice Strayer further stated the validity of the constitution in that case was a question of political legitimacy, and was a question the court should not seek to answer in the absence of some \"discernible legal criteria\".", "081": "[81]\nIt is undisputed that the respondent Ron Hall has exercised the office of Band Chief since March of 1994.\n3. Office Created By An\nAct Of Parliament", "064": "[64]\nThere remains the first option which, in my view, is the most desirable. However, the evidence summarized above amounts to no more than a weak inference that the\nCode\nreceived the support of the Band membership. I think the answer is to be found in the conduct of the Band in relation to the March 14, 1994, election and the events that followed. The Band conducted the nomination proceedings, the election and the subsequent election appeal, all in accordance with the\nCode\n. According to the Affidavit of the respondent Hall, there were 478 votes cast for the election of the Band Chief. Although neither party led evidence as to the total number of eligible voters at the time of the election, the respondent Hall deposed that at the time of the plebiscites there were 964 Band members of voting age, including nonresidents. Thus, it can be said that approximately 50% of the eligible voters participated in the March 14, 1994, election. There is no evidence that at any time before or during the election any Band member objected to the manner in which the election by Band custom was proceeding. In my view, the conduct of the Band in acquiescing in the use of the\nCode\n, is sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement of Justice Strayer, as set out in\nBigstone\n, supra, that it was \"generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus\", and therefore reflects the Band's custom.", "107": "[107]\nIn view of the determination of the above issues, resolution of this issue is no longer necessary.\nV. Conclusion", "033": "[33]\nReturning to Justice Strayer's definition of \"custom\", the question remains as to whether the\nCode\nreflects the Band's custom: does it enunciate practices that are generally acceptable to members of the band and upon which there is a broad consensus?\nRevocation Of The S. 74\nMinisterial Order", "046": "[46]\nWhat is the significance of this noncompliance with the Department's policy? In my view, it has no effect on the validity of the Deputy Minister's order repealing the s. 74 order. A ministerial order is in the discretion of the Minister: this policy was merely directory, not mandatory. However, I do think it weakens the weight to be accorded the inference that the Department's requirements were satisfied and thus there was evidence of Band membership support of the electoral system to be employed following revocation of the s. 74 order.\nDraft Code In Existence\nAt Time Of Plebiscites", "050": "[50]\nThe draft version contained in Exhibit B has a line at the bottom of each page which reads: \"3rd drft-28-06-93mr\". This suggests it is the third draft version, and is dated June 28, 1993. That was the date of the first plebiscite. However, also included in Exhibit B are two pages entitled \"Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code Summary\", which contain a line at the bottom of each page which reads \"25 June 1993 MR\". These two pages purport to summarize the election code, and they do include a paragraph setting out the residency requirement. Although this document appears to pre-date the \"third draft version\" of the\nCode\n, the version this document claims to summarize apparently did contain the residency requirement. These two documents together constitute Exhibit B of the respondent Hall's affidavit.", "037": "[37]\nThere was a minor infraction of the Department's procedure, namely, that the second plebiscite was to be held within one month of the first plebiscite. However, it was in fact held two days later, on July 30, 1993. I am of the view this minor deviation from the policy is inconsequential.", "058": "[58]\nAccordingly, in my view the respondents' find themselves in a difficult position. They have conceded that the\nIndian Act\nno longer governs the Band Council elections, and they have attacked the validity of the\nCode\n. As a result, they have taken the position that the legal basis for their election may be found in the unwritten custom of the Band, which they submit the election complied with. There are two difficulties with this argument. The first difficulty is the one referred to supra: if the election was consistent with the\nCode\nand was also consistent with the unwritten custom, then the\nCode\nand custom must be one and the same.", "052": "[52]\nFurthermore, the respondents have not submitted that the draft version that was available at the time of the plebiscites did not contain the residency clause.", "041": "[41]\nThe Department's policy that the Band was seeking to comply with in holding the plebiscites stated that Band electors, as defined in the\nIndian Act\n, were eligible to vote. The respondents submitted that the definition of elector in the\nAct\ndid not contain a residency requirement. The applicant responded to this submission by contending that the law in question in 1993 did indeed contain a residency requirement. This issue can be resolved simply by recourse to the applicable statute at the material time.", "031": "[31]\nIt seems clear that this is a \"definition\" provision rather than an \"empowering\" provision. It simply states that a council of a band is either a council chosen according to the Band's custom or, if a ministerial order is in effect pursuant to s. 74(1) of the\nAct\n, it is a council that has been elected in accordance with the\nIndian Act\n. It does not confer a power upon a Band to develop a custom for selecting its council. Rather, it recognizes that an Indian Band has customs, developed over decades if not centuries, which may include a custom for selecting the Band's Chief and Councillors. The definition of \"council of a band\" acknowledges that prior to the enactment of the\nIndian Act\nin 1951, Indian Bands had their own methods for selecting the Band Council. The power or ability to continue choosing the Band Council in the customary manner is left intact by the\nIndian Act\n, except in those cases where the power is removed from the Band by a ministerial order under s. 74(1) of the\nAct\n.", "078": "[78]\nWithout having to decide whether or not a person may have more than one residence, I am of the view that the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve as of March 14, 1993. The fact that he did commence residing on the Reserve at any time subsequent to March 14, 1993, is of no avail to him, as the Code clearly requires a candidate for the office of Chief or Councillor to have resided on the Reserve for a minimum of 12 months prior to the election date. Accordingly, the respondent Hall was not eligible to run as a candidate for Chief in the March 14, 1994, election and accordingly, is not entitled to hold office as Chief.", "018": "[18]\nThe respondents have conceded that in relation to the declaratory and injunctive relief sought, the limitation provision is not applicable.

Firstly, as was discussed above, s. 2(3) of the\nAct\nhas no relevance to these proceedings. However, the respondents second submission warrants discussion.", "077": "[77]\nThe question remains: as of March 14, 1993, did the respondent Hall reside on the Reserve? According to his own testimony supra, it is apparent that as of March, 1993, the material date, the respondent Hall had not even slept in House 3700. In March of 1993 the respondent Hall was the owner of a house located on the Reserve. He had moved some of his possessions into the house and occasionally ate a meal there. However, at the material time he also held joint title to a home located off the Reserve, in Brandon, where the remainder of his possessions were located and where he and his family slept every night.", "045": "[45]\nThus, the respondents were correct in submitting that nonresident Band members should have been given the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites.", "098": "[98]\nAs to the first means of removing respondent Hall, that is the avenue the applicant chose to pursue: an appeal to the Elections Appeal Board.

However, I disagree with the respondents' submission that this is a \"power conferred on a band\" as is contemplated by s. 2(3)(a) of the\nIndian Act\n.", "069": "[69]\nSection 19 of the\nCode\nempowers the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the\nCode\n.

The Council of the Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate will, in advance of the March 1994 election,\ndevelop and submit to the community for approval, regulations to give effect to this Code\nand, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, will develop regulations with respect to:\n(a) nomination procedures,\n(b) appointment and tasks of electoral officers,\n(c) election procedures,\n(d) appointment and tasks of election appeal board members, and\n(e) appeal procedures.\" (Emphasis added) [see footnote 30]\nThe\nRegulations\n, included in Exhibit G of the applicant's affidavit, are dated February 8, 1994. There has been no evidence led to rebut the inference that these\nRegulations\nwere not in existence, in their present form, prior to that date. Accordingly, they certainly were not available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. The reason I draw attention to this fact arises from the wording of the above enabling provision. It states that the Council was to \"develop and submit to the community for approval\" regulations to give effect to the\nCode\n. The fact that the\nRegulations\nwere not even in existence at the time of the plebiscites eliminates any possibility they received community approval at that juncture. In fact, the applicant did not lead any evidence to support a finding that these\nRegulations\nwere submitted to the community for approval in any manner.", "071": "[71]\nThe applicant appealed the results of the March 14, 1994, election pursuant to s. 15.1 of the\nCode\n, by submitting a written appeal within seven days of the election to the Election Appeals Board. [see footnote 31] Pursuant to that appeal, the Election Appeal Board issued an order, dated March 26, 1994, declaring that a new general election be held. The power to order a new election is conferred upon the Elections Appeal Board by s. 13(3) of the\nRegulations\n. [see footnote 32] The\nCode\nitself does not empower the Board to grant such an order. Accordingly, a declaration of invalidity of the\nRegulations\nrenders the order for a new general election ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Elections Appeal Board.", "095": "[95]\nThe Elections Appeal Board's order was not rendered until March 26, 1994. Taking into consideration that a reasonable amount of time had to be allowed to permit the Band Council to comply with the order, I am of the view that filing the application for judicial review six months following the election, in these circumstances, was not an unreasonable length of time since the election.\n9. All Internal Relief Avenues Exhausted", "057": "[57]\nThe respondents' position is that the March 14, 1994, election was held in accordance with Band custom. However, the Band's custom was not reflected in the\nCode\n. Rather, the respondents submitted that the Band Council was elected in accordance with the unwritten custom of the Band. If that proposition is accepted, then I am of the view that such a circumstance in fact supports the applicant's submission that the\nCode\nreflects the Band's custom. That is, if one accepts that the election proceeded in a manner consistent with the Band's unwritten custom, then since this unwritten custom mirrored the alleged written custom (the\nCode\n), it follows that the\nCode\nsets out in writing the custom of the Band. I am of the view that if one accepts the first proposition, it is also necessary to accept the second proposition, namely, that the\nCode\nreflects the Band's custom.", "067": "[67]\nFirstly, although it is the\nCode\nthat contains the residency requirement in relation to a candidate for the office of Band Chief, it is the\nRegulations\nthat contain the stringent definition of the words \"resided on the Reserve\". The respondent Hall has conceded that if the\nRegulations\nare found to be valid, that he does not meet the residency requirement, as it is defined in the\nRegulations\n. [see footnote 29] However, the respondent Hall further submitted that if the court determined that the\nCode\nwas valid, but the\nRegulations\nwere invalid, then he maintained his position that he\ndoes\nmeet the residency requirement, as articulated in the\nCode\nalone.", "023": "[23]\nPrior to March 14, 1994, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the\nIndian Act\n, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the Indian Band Council Election Order of the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated December 14, 1989. There is no dispute between the parties that the ministerial order pursuant to s. 74(1) was revoked by an order of the Deputy Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated February 7, 1994. [see footnote 15] Thereafter, the Band's Council was defined by the provisions of part (b) of the definition of \"council of a band\" found in s. 2 of the\nIndian Act\nand was, therefore to be chosen according to the custom of the band.", "014": "[14]\nSection 18.1(2) requires that an application for judicial review in respect of a decision or order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal be made within 30 days after the time the decision or order is first communicated by the federal board to the party directly affected thereby.", "102": "[102]\nThe following are additional factors to be considered with respect to an order in the nature of quo warranto:\n10.

Plaintiff Guilty Of Aquiescence", "044": "[44]\nHowever, s. 77(1) has no relevance to these proceedings. The votes in question, in the plebiscites of June and July, 1993, were not elections as contemplated by s. 77 of the\nIndian Act\n: they were not elections for the office of Chief and/or Councillors. The votes in question were plebiscites held to comply with the Department's policy in relation to the revocation of a s. 74 ministerial order. The said policy incorporated the definition of elector as found in the\nIndian Act\n, which is set out above. This definition does not contain a residency requirement. It does provide for the disqualification of a potential elector in part (c) of the definition. And, as was discussed above, prior to the decision in\nBatchewana\n, if the election were for Chief or Councillor, an elector was disqualified if he/she did not reside on the Reserve. However, the plebiscites in question were not such elections. Furthermore, there was no provision in the\nAct\nthat disqualified electors for any reason, with respect to a plebiscite. Therefore, in my view, it follows that if a Band member had met the first two requirements of the definition, that is he/she was registered on the Band List and was 18 years of age or older, then he/she was an eligible elector according to this definition, and accordingly should have had the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites held in pursuance of the Department's policy. However, this was not the case. Nonresident Band members were not considered eligible voters and were not permitted the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites. In spite of this apparent deviation from the Department's policy, on the basis of the plebiscite results, the Department did recommend to the Minister that the s. 74 order be repealed.", "005": "[5]\nIn an effort to reduce the Band's custom into a recognizable form, the\nSioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code\n(the \"\nCode\n\") was drafted. The applicant has included a copy of the final version of the\nCode\nin his affidavit [see footnote 3]; it is dated July, 1993. In addition to the\nCode\n, the\nSioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Elections Regulations\n(the \"\nRegulations\n\") were developed, a copy of which is also included in the applicant's affidavit, and it is dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 4] A third document was also drafted, entitled the\nSioux Valley Dakota Oyate Code of Ethics\n(the \"\nCode of Ethics\n\"), a copy of which is found in the applicant's affidavit and is also dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 5]", "076": "[76]\nIn support of his submissions as to residency on the Reserve, the respondent Hall attached as Exhibit J to his Affidavit business records of the Band which indicate that financial assistance was provided to himself and his wife during the period of January, 1993, to March of 1994. In his view, this was evidence that he was resident on the Reserve, as according to established Band policy, no Band member is eligible for such assistance unless such member is resident on the Reserve. In my view, marginal weight ought to be accorded this evidence. The definition of \"residence\" for the purpose of receiving financial assistance is not determinative of the issue at hand.", "026": "[26]\nJustice Strayer in\nBigstone v. Big Eagle\n(1992), 52 F.T.R. 109 (F.C.T.D.), was also asked to determine the validity of rules adopted to govern a band's election procedure, which was to be in accordance with the band's custom. His Lordship noted that the\nIndian Act\nprovided \"no guidance as to how that custom is to be identified\". [\nBigstone\n, at p. 117] He stated the following at pp. 117 and 118:\n\"\nUnless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, 'custom' must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus.\nWith a newly re-established band whose circumstances are vastly different (e.g. the majority not being resident on the reserve) from those of the band dissolved some 90 years earlier, it is not surprising that innovative measures would have to be taken to establish a contemporary 'custom'. The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band? This is a question which a court should not seek to answer in the absence of some discernable legal criteria which it can apply. While there might be some other basis for judicial supervision if there were clear evidence of fraud or other acts on the part of the defendants which could clearly not be authorized by the\nIndian Act\n, there is no evidence of any such activities before me.\" (emphasis added) [\nBigstone\n, at pp. 117-118]", "093": "[93]\nThe election was in March of 1994, and within a few days of the election the applicant appealed the results to the Election Appeal Board. However, the applicant did not actually file the originating notice of motion with respect to this application until October of 1994. The applicant deposed in his affidavit that following the election, the Band's auditors conducted an audit with respect to certain Band financial matters. He deposed he did not attempt to institute court proceedings with respect to his challenge to the election results until after the audit was completed, as he felt it would be in the best interests of the Band for any questions regarding the results of this audit to be resolved prior to any court challenge.", "089": "[89]\nIn full awareness that the respondent Hall, the applicant's sole competition for the office of Chief, did not meet the residency requirement of the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\n, the applicant accepted his own nomination for the office of Chief and participated in the election which followed. The applicant allowed his office as Band Chief, which he had held for the previous eight years, to be contested by a candidate he believed was not even eligible to run. However, the applicant did not draw this to the attention of the electoral officer. Rather, he let the tainted process continue. It was only once the election results were known that the applicant publicly disputed the respondent Hall's eligibility to hold office. I am of the view that in light of these circumstances, it can fairly be said the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.", "094": "[94]\nThe applicant's counsel further addressed the issue of delay at the hearing. Apparently the applicant encountered a number of difficulties in retaining counsel in relation to this application for judicial review. Finally in August of 1994 he retained his present counsel. However, the Originating Notice was not filed until October of 1994.", "055": "[55]\nThe respondents' Counsel submitted in argument that in order for a band to elect a Council, they do not need a written constitution. He further submitted that the method of obtaining a Council could be anything that has the force of custom within the band. As an example, he submitted a band may have an unwritten custom that the Chief is to be the fastest runner in the band.

Does The Court Have Jurisdiction\nTo Grant A Declaration?", "075": "[75]\nIt is not disputed that on August 31, 1992, House No. 3700, which is located on the Reserve, was transferred from Louise Hall, the respondent Hall's sister, to the respondent Hall. [see footnote 33] However, it is also not disputed that prior to August 31, 1992, and at least until May 31, 1993, the respondent Hall also held title to a residential property located at 12 Beech Boulevard, in Brandon, Manitoba, which was not on the Reserve. [see footnote 34] The respondent Hall stated, under oath, during cross-examination upon his affidavit that sometime in October of 1992 he moved some furniture into House 3700, in November of 1992 he began eating lunch in House 3700 occasionally, and in April or May of 1993 he began sleeping in House 3700 occasionally on weekends, as he had began renovations. Prior to this he had continued to sleep at his residence in Brandon. The respondent Hall further stated that he had three school-aged children, who attended school in Brandon during the school term of September, 1992 to June, 1993. None of the children ever slept at House 3700 until April or May of 1993. It was not until the later part of May, 1993, that he began sleeping exclusively at House 3700.

Rather it is an inherent power of the Band; it is a power the Band has always had, which the\nIndian Act\nonly interferes with in limited circumstances, as provided for under s. 74 of the\nAct\n. Thus, in my view the Band may exercise this inherent power unrestrained by s. 2(3)(a) of the\nIndian Act\n.", "105": "[105]\nIn summary, there is one serious impediment to a determination that an order in the nature of quo warranto is appropriate in these circumstances: the applicant acquiesced in the respondent Hall's candidacy for the office of Band Chief. In my view, in light of the circumstances of this case, this fact is sufficient to render an order in the nature of quo warranto inappropriate.\n5. Should The Respondent Band Council\nBe Required To Hold A New General\nElection For The Offices Of Band Chief\nAnd Councillors By The Issuance\nOf A Writ Of Mandamus?", "038": "[38]\nHowever, there is an important difficulty in relation to the plebiscite: neither party adduced evidence as to what question was put to the voters in either of these plebiscites. Incredibly, neither party, that is neither the person who was Band Chief at the time of the plebiscites, the applicant Robert Bone, or the people who presently hold the positions of Band Chief and Councillors, the respondents, presented affidavit evidence as to the content of the plebiscite question. Unfortunately, absence of this evidence makes disposition of this matter more difficult.", "054": "[54]\nThe next event that is relevant to the applicant's submission that the\nCode\nreflects the Band's custom is the March 14, 1994, election itself.

The applicant has not brought this application in order to quash a decision or order of a federal board, but rather seeks remedies including an order in the nature of mandamus, to compel a federal board to fulfil a duty.", "015": "[15]\nThe applicant made two submissions. Firstly, the applicant submitted that with respect to the remedy of quo warranto, it is apparent from the Federal Court decision in\nJock v. Canada\n, [1991] 2 F.C. 355; 41 F.T.R. 189 (T.D.)

Should the respondent Hall be prevented from running as a candidate in a new election for the office of Band Chief by the issuance of an injunction?\nIV. Analysis", "063": "[63]\nI am of the view, for reasons stated earlier, that the second option is not sound in law. There is no reason for this court to accept that the election proceeded according to unwritten Band custom, when the respondents have failed to produce any evidence in support of this submission, i.e. they have not produced evidence of what, in their view, is the Band's custom in relation to the selection of the Band Council.", "079": "[79]\nThe issue now is to determine if an order in the nature of quo warranto should issue in the circumstances of this case. Justice Teitelbaum in\nJock\n, supra, set out the following rules in regards to the issuance of a writ of quo warranto:\n\"According to de Smith's\nJudicial Review of Administrative Action\n(4th Ed. by J.M. Evans, 1980), the old substantive law rules for quo warranto, with only slight modifications, still apply, as listed below (at pp. 463-464):\n1. The office must be one of a public nature.\n2. The holder must have already exercised the office; a mere claim to exercise it is not enough.\n3. The office must have been created by the Crown, by a Royal Charter, or by an Act of Parliament.\n4. The office must not be that of a deputy or servant who can be dismissed at will.\n5. A plaintiff will be barred from a remedy if the plaintif [sic] has been guilty of acquiescence in the usurpation of office or undue delay.\n6. The plaintiff must have a genuine interest in the proceedings. Nowadays probably any member of the public will have sufficient interest, provided that he has no private interest to serve.\n\"The following matters are within the discretion of the court (Dussault and Borgeat,\nAdministrative Law: A Treatise\n, 1990, p. 388):\n7. Standing of the applicant.\n8. The reasonableness of the length of time elapsed since the election.\n9. The appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted.\n\"The following are some additional factors to be considered in a discussion of the remedy of quo warranto:\n10. Whether the onus is on the applicant or the respondent to prove his case.\n11. Whether the remedy of quo warranto may be granted independent of any other remedy.\" (\nJock\n, supra, at pp. 370-371.)\nThe above factors must now be applied to the facts of the case at bar.\n1. Office Of A Public Nature", "109": "[109]\nThe aggregate result of the above determinations is as follows. The Band Council finds its legal basis for holding office in the\nCode\n. The next Band Council election, which by my calculation is due to occur within the next couple of months, may proceed in accordance with the\nCode\n. If the Band membership is dissatisfied with the present state of the\nCode\n, s. 22 of the\nCode\nembodies an amending provision. Although the\nRegulations\nhave been declared invalid, there is nothing preventing the present Band Council from developing valid regulations and submitting them to the community for approval.", "065": "[65]\nAccordingly, I declare that the\nCode\nwas in force as of March 14, 1994.\n3. Should The Court Declare\nThat The Sioux Valley Dakota\nOyate Custom Elections Regulations\nWere In Force On March 14, 1994?", "008": "[8]\nFollowing the election, on March 18, 1994, the applicant appealed the election of the respondent Hall, pursuant to s. 15.1 of the\nCode\n, on the basis that he had not met the residency requirement set out in the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\n. [see footnote 10] Section 7 of the\nCode\nrequires candidates for Band Council to have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election. Section 16(4) of the\nRegulations\nprovides for an interpretation of the words \"resided on the Reserve\" in the\nCode\n. [see footnote 11] An Election Appeals Board was established pursuant to the provisions of the\nCode\n, and on or about March 26, 1994, the Board ordered that a new general election be held. Pursuant to s. 2(1) of the\nRegulations\n, only the Itancan, defined as the Chief and Council, is empowered to call an election. However, the respondent Hall has refused to step down as Chief and the respondent Band Council has refused to call a new election.", "061": "[61]\nDespite all of the difficulties cited supra, an election was held on March 14, 1994, and as a result the respondents attained their positions as Chief and Band Council. In my view, there are three possible conclusions to be drawn concerning this election:\n1. The\nCode\nis valid, and accordingly the election had a legal basis and the results stand, subject to the ruling of the Elections Appeal Board.\n2. The\nCode\nis invalid, however the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom and thus had a legal basis and, accordingly, the results thereof should prevail.\n3. The\nCode\nis invalid, and since there is no evidence that the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom, the election had no legal basis and accordingly the results are null and void.", "104": "[104]\nJustice Teitelbaum in\nJock\n, supra, held that quo warranto could be granted independent of any other remedy.", "035": "[35]\nIn the case at bar, two plebiscites were held on the Band's reserve, for the purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The Department's policy sets out the procedure to be followed by a band that chooses to demonstrate the support of its membership in this manner. The procedure provided that if those who voted in favour of the proposed repeal and alternate system did not constitute a simple majority of all eligible voters, that a second plebiscite must be held within one month, at which only the support of a simple majority of those who voted was necessary.", "047": "[47]\nThe next question for consideration is the following: what system was proposed at the time of the plebiscites? The respondent Hall deposed in his affidavit that at the time of the first plebiscite, there was a draft version of the\nCode\nin existence, and it was available to interested voters. [see footnote 21] Attached as an exhibit to his affidavit is a copy of the draft version of the\nCode\n. [see footnote 22] The applicant attached the final version of the\nCode\nas an exhibit to his affidavit [see footnote 23], but did not lead evidence as to the draft version of the\nCode\navailable at the time of the plebiscites.", "101": "[101]\nThe third internal relief avenue said by the respondents to have been available to the applicant is to be found in s. 79 of the\nIndian Act\n, which reads as follows:\n\"79. The Governor-in-Council may set aside the election of a chief or councillor of a band on the report of the Minister that he is satisfied that\n(a) there was corrupt practice in connection with the election;\n(b) there was a contravention of this Act that might have affected the result of the election; or\n(c) a person nominated to be a candidate in the election was ineligible to be a candidate.\"\nJustice Teitelbaum in\nJock\n, supra, was of the view in that case that s. 79 offered an internal avenue of relief, even though the election in dispute was held according to band custom, rather than under the\nIndian Act\n. With all due respect, I am of the view that s. 79 is not applicable to band council elections that are not governed by the\nIndian Act\n, which is the case here. In the absence of a ministerial order pursuant to s. 74 of the\nAct\n, the election provisions of the\nAct\nare inapplicable to a band council election. Accordingly, in my view this was not an avenue of internal relief available to the applicant.", "013": "[13]\nAs a preliminary issue, the respondents have submitted that the applicant is out of time in bringing this application by virtue of ss. 18(3) and 18.1(2) of the\nFederal Court Act\n. These sections, as they were at the material time, read as follows:\n\"18(1) Subject to s. 28, the Trial Division has exclusive original jurisdiction\n(a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and\n(b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal.\n\"(2) The Trial Division has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine every application for a writ of 'habeas corpus ad subjiciendum', writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition or writ of mandamus in relation to any member of the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada.\n\"(3) The remedies provided for in subss.

The impugned Council in that case had also been elected according to the custom of the band.\n4. Deputy Or Servant That\nMay Be Dismissed At Will", "039": "[39]\nIn the absence of evidence of the question posed upon the plebiscite ballots, the results of the plebiscite have limited use. At most, the court could infer that as the plebiscites were held for the purpose of meeting the Department's criteria for recommending the repeal of a s. 74 order, and since the order was in fact ultimately repealed, the Department's requirements must have been satisfied. If the court chooses to draw this inference, then the corollary is that the plebiscite indicated support by the band membership of a repeal of s. 74\nand\nof the election system to be employed thereafter.", "070": "[70]\nAs I concluded above that the\nCode\nis valid and reflects the Band's custom, it can therefore be said that the Band's custom permits the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the\nCode\n, subject to one condition: the Band Council must submit the said regulations to the community for approval. I am of the view that unless this condition has been satisfied, any regulations purportedly developed pursuant to s. 19 are invalid. Since no evidence has been adduced to establish that the\nRegulations\nwere approved by the community, I am of the view they must be declared invalid. The Band Council acted ultra vires the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s. 19 of the\nCode\n.\nWhat Is The Effect Of A Declaration\nThat The Regulations Are Invalid\nOn The Order Of The\nElections Appeal Board?", "056": "[56]\nI agree with the respondents' Counsel, as noted, supra, that the custom of the Band does not necessarily have to be written into a Code or Bylaws. The respondents' Counsel takes the position that the March 14, 1994, election was not to have been conducted in accordance with the\nIndian Act\n, because the s. 74 order was repealed, and that it was not to have been conducted in accordance with the\nCode\n, as this\nCode\ndoes not reflect the Band's custom. Accordingly, the respondents' counsel submitted that at the time of the March 14, 1994, election, there was no legally adopted constitution governing Band Council elections. [see footnote 27] However, the respondents' continue to maintain that they are a legally constituted Band council on the basis that they were \"\nelected properly by a majority of the voters in accordance with some of the customs albeit unwritten\n\" (emphasis added). [see footnote 28] The respondents' had to make this assertion; otherwise, there is no legal basis for the respondents' holding office as Band Council. However, if the court accepts this assertion of the respondents, and then takes it one step further, the result is in fact detrimental to the respondents.", "006": "[6]\nBy a letter dated February 3, 1994, Wendy Porteous of the Department, recommended to the Deputy Minister that the s. 74 ministerial order be repealed. By an order dated February 7, 1994, the Deputy Minister, Dan Goodleaf, revoked the ministerial order of December 14, 1989, insofar as it applied to the Sioux Valley Band, and declared that on and after March 14, 1994, the council of the Band would be selected in accordance with the custom of the Band. [see footnote 6]", "074": "[74]\nIt must therefore be determined whether the respondent Hall is disentitled from holding office by virtue of the residency requirement as set out in the\nCode\n. Section 7 of the\nCode\nreads as follows:\n\"7. Dakota Oyate members who are 18 years of age or over, and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election date may run for Chief and Councillor.\"\nTherefore, if the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve for the 12 months prior to the election date, that is during the period of March 14, 1993, to March 14, 1994, then he was not eligible to run for Chief. Unfortunately, the\nCode\nitself does not provide an interpretation of the words \"resided on the Reserve\": that interpretation was included in the\nRegulations\n, which I have concluded are invalid. Accordingly, s. 7 of the\nCode\nmust be interpreted without the assistance of a definition.", "086": "[86]\nThe applicant's response to this submission is contained in the applicant's counsel's argument at pp. 84 and 85 of the transcripts as follows:\n\"Mr. Nelko: ... [T]he fact is that acquiescence may come to play with respect to quo warranto. If an individual has, in fact, participated in the process, an argument is advanced that, in fact, by acquiescing to the process, that may, in fact, disentitle you from the relief.\n\"Of course, we have a backward situation here where we're suggesting that the respondents in fact, have acquiesced in the process and that should estop them from in fact arguing that the process is invalid.\" [see footnote 38]\nI agree with the applicant that the respondents have acquiesced in the process, assuming the applicant is referring to the process by which the respondents were elected to the Band Council. However, this conduct on the part of the respondents is completely irrelevant to the question of whether or not the applicant himself acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.", "066": "[66]\nThe next issue to be determined is the validity of the\nRegulations\n, purportedly enacted in pursuance of the\nCode\n. The validity of the\nRegulations\nis significant to the outcome of this application for two reasons.", "043": "[43]\nThus, the definition of \"elector\" in the\nAct\ndid not contain a requirement the elector be resident on the Reserve. However, with respect to specific types of votes, per part (c) of the definition, an elector may be disqualified from voting by a provision of the\nAct\n. For example, if the vote in question was an election for the office of Chief or Councillor, held pursuant to the\nIndian Act\n, then per s. 77(1) of the\nAct\n, as it was in 1993, an elector was disqualified from voting unless he/she was ordinarily resident on the Reserve. [see footnote 19] The\nIndian Band Election Regulations\nfurther defined \"ordinarily resident\" for the purposes of the Band Council elections. Justice Strayer, in\nBatchewana Indian Band (Non-Resident Members) v. Batchewana Indian Band\n, [1994] 1 F.C. 394; 87 F.T.R. 183 (T.D.), declared s. 77(1) of the\nIndian Act\nto be in contravention of s. 15 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n[see footnote 20], in a decision dated September 9, 1993. However, Justice Strayer suspended operation of his decision until July 1, 1994, to allow Parliament time to consider amending the\nAct\n. The applicant's counsel in the case at bar correctly submitted in argument that at the material time, June and July of 1993, s. 77(1) was in effect, as this was prior to Justice Strayer's decision.", "087": "[87]\nThe facts are these: the respondent Hall was nominated as a candidate for the office of Band Chief at a nomination meeting held on February 28, 1994. The applicant was present at that meeting and was also nominated for the candidacy of Band Chief. No person, including the applicant, objected to the respondent Hall's nomination at that time or at any time prior to the March 14, 1994, election. [see footnote 39] It is not disputed that at the time of the respondent Hall's nomination the applicant was fully aware that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement as was set out in the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\n. It is also not disputed that the applicant did not challenge the respondent Hall's eligibility for the office of Chief until the election was concluded.", "020": "[20]\nThe respondents also submitted, in their Memorandum of Argument, that the sole ground for relief sought was a technical irregularity, and therefore under s. 18.1(5) of the\nFederal Court Act\n, the court may refuse the relief if it finds that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. The respondents did not make submissions in this regard at the hearing. In my view, this argument has no merit. The analysis of the issues below establishes that the grounds upon which this application is based go beyond a \"defect in form or a technical irregularity\" as those expressions are employed in subs. 18.1(5).\n2. Should The Court Declare That\nThe Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom\nElection Code Was In Force\nOn March 14, 1994?", "002": "[2]\nOn March 14, 1994, the Sioux Valley Indian Band No. 290 (the \"Band\") held an election for Band Chief and Band Council. Elections for the council of the band may be governed by either the provisions of the\nIndian Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, (the \"\nAct\n\") or by band custom, pursuant to ss. 2(1) and 74 of the\nAct\n. Section 2(1) of the\nAct\ndefines council of the band as follows:\n\"'council of the band' means\n(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established\npursuant to that section\n,\n(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen\naccording to the custom of the band\n, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band;\" (emphasis added)\nSection 74(1) of the\nAct\nreads as follows:\n\"74(1) Whenever he deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that after a day to be named therein the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this Act.\"", "110": "[110]\nAs neither party has made submissions as to special reasons for an order of costs, no costs shall be payable in respect of this application.\nOrder accordingly.", "048": "[48]\nI have compared the draft version of the\nCode\nsaid by the respondent Hall to have been available at the time of the plebiscites, to the final version of the\nCode\n. There are indeed differences between the draft version and the final version, some of which are relatively minor, and some of which are quite significant. One significant difference, is the inclusion in the draft version of six provisions regarding conflict of interest. [see footnote 24] These were removed from the final version, and instead form the substance of the third document, entitled\nCode of Ethics\n. [see footnote 25]", "053": "[53]\nTherefore, in my view it can not now be said with certainty that the draft version of the\nCode\navailable to Band members at the time of the plebiscites is the version contained in Exhibit B of the respondent Hall's affidavit. It seems to me that the only conclusion the court can draw from this evidence\nis that there is no clear evidence\nestablishing which draft version of the\nCode\nwas available to voters at the time of the plebiscite, and whether or not it contained the residency clause.\nThe Conduct Of The\nMarch 14, 1994 Election", "085": "[85]\nThe respondent has submitted evidence to support the contention that the applicant believed at the time of the nominations, that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement. [see footnote 36] The applicant admitted in cross-examination on affidavit by the respondents' counsel, that at the nomination meeting he believed that the respondent Hall did not qualify to be a candidate because of the residency requirement. When questioned by the respondents' counsel as to why he did not object to the respondent Hall running at that time, he responded it was his opinion that it was the job of the Chief Electoral Officer to tell Mr. Hall that he could not run. respondents' counsel inquired as to whether the applicant approached the Chief Electoral Officer after the nomination meeting to tell her that it was his view Mr. Hall was ineligible. The applicant responded he did not because there was a movement on the reserve by the supporters of Mr. Hall, going around house to house with a petition to evict the applicant and his family from the community. [see footnote 37] The respondents therefore submitted that the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent.", "049": "[49]\nThe second major difference between the two versions is of particular relevance to these proceedings. The final version of the\nCode\ncontains the provision, in paragraph 7, that restricts eligible candidates for Chief or Councillor to members who are 18 years of age or over and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months, prior to the election date. This is the provision that the applicant relies upon for his assertion that the respondent Hall was ineligible to run for the office of Chief. However, this very provision is\nnot\ncontained in the draft version, which the respondents submitted was the version available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. In fact, the draft version does not contain any such residency requirement.", "106": "[106]\nAs I concluded above that the order of the Elections Appeal Board that a new general election be called is ultra vires the Board's jurisdiction, there is no basis for this court to make an order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Band Council to hold a new general election.\n6. Should The Respondent Ron Hall\nBe Prevented From Running As A\nCandidate In A New Election For\nThe Office Of Band Chief By\nAn Injunction?", "011": "[11]\nPrior to embarking on an analysis of the issues before the court, the position of two of the respondents, those being Mr. Ironman and Mr. Pratt, must be clarified. The respondents Ironman and Pratt were represented at the hearing by Mr. Lee, whereas the remaining respondents, were represented by Mr. Sheldon, Q.C. The respondents Ironman and Pratt, through their counsel Mr. Lee, indicated at the hearing that they agreed with the applicant with respect to items 1, 2, 3 and 4 of his Amended Originating Notice of Motion, but disagreed with item 6, being the injunction sought to prevent the respondent Hall from running as a candidate, should the determination of this application result in a new election. This was the extent of the respondents Ironman and Pratt's submissions.", "034": "[34]\nThe applicant provided evidence to support his submission that the\nCode\nreceived Band approval. As was discussed above, it is not disputed that the ministerial order that brought the Band Council elections under the governance of the\nIndian Act\n, was revoked in February of 1994. Attached as an exhibit to the Affidavit of Robert Bone, filed on behalf of the applicant, is a copy of the policy and procedures to be followed by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, for the purpose of recommending to the Minister that an order pursuant to s. 74 be repealed. Paragraph 2 of the policy states:\n\"Where a band wishes to have a s. 74 order repealed, the department must ensure that the band has, or will have, a system in place which is supported by the band membership and which protects the rights of the individual band members.\"\nThe policy further states that evidence of band membership support may be obtained at a public band meeting, by petition, by plebiscite or by other means within the custom of the Band.", "073": "[73]\nThe respondent Hall may only be removed from office of the Band Chief by the issuance of a writ of quo warranto if the court is satisfied that the respondent Hall has no legal basis for holding this position. Since I have concluded supra that the order of the Elections Appeal Board is invalid, the applicant is unable to rely on the order of the Elections Appeal Board in support of his submission that the respondent Hall is thereby disentitled to hold the office of Band Chief.", "062": "[62]\nIn my view, the third option is the least desirable. This choice leaves the Band in a serious quandary. Firstly, it leaves the Band without a Band Council. Secondly, it leaves the Band without a generally accepted Band custom as to how a new Band Council ought to be selected. The result of this option would likely be chaotic.", "009": "[9]\nThe respondent Hall deposed in his affidavit, that on March 23, 1994, upon learning that the applicant was questioning his eligibility to stand for the office of Chief, he sought legal advice from his current legal counsel, Mr. Sheldon. In addition, he consulted the Council of Elders regarding his eligibility as a candidate and whether he should be a candidate in a new election. The Elders endorsed the legal opinion given to him, and advised against submission to a new election. A majority of the duly elected Band Council gave similar advice. Based on these conversations, the respondent Hall deposed that he concluded there was negligible support for a new election or for the\nCode\n. [see footnote 12]", "012": "[12]\nIn the analysis below, any reference to the \"respondents\" is intended as a reference to the respondents other than respondents Ironman and Pratt.\n1. Is The Applicant Out Of Time\nIn Bringing This Application\nBy Virtue Of SS. 18(3) And 18.1(2)\nOf The Federal Court Act,\nR.S.C. 1985, C. F-7?", "059": "[59]\nThe second difficulty with the respondents' contention arises from their earlier submission that holding an election pursuant to Band custom is a power conferred on the Band, and thus must be exercised in accordance with s. 2(3) of the\nIndian Act\n, which requires support of a majority of the Band members. Although I have rejected this argument, for reasons given supra, that does not alter the fact that it is the respondents' position. If the Band is to exercise this \"conferred power\" by developing a written\nCode\nencompassing the Band's custom, which the respondent's have submitted would require the support of a majority of the Band's membership, it then follows that if the Band chooses to exercise this \"conferred power\" by using unwritten customs to conduct an election, this exercise of power would similarly require the support of a majority of the Band's membership. To use the respondents' counsel's own example, if the unwritten custom of the Band was to have the fastest runner as Band Chief, then before the Band exercised its \"conferred power\" to hold a race to determine who the fastest runner was, the Band would require support of the Band membership to exercise the power in this manner.", "028": "[28]\nThe respondents submitted that the objective legal criteria sought by Justice Strayer could be found in s. 2(3)(a) of the\nIndian Act\n. This section reads as follows:\n\"2(3) Unless the context otherwise requires or this Act otherwise provides,\n(a) a power conferred on a band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of a majority of the electors of the band; and ...\"", "097": "[97]\nThe respondents' submit, that if the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\nwere in effect, there were three means of removing Mr. Hall from office:\n(1) an order of the Election Appeal Board under s. 15.2 of the\nCode\nand s. 13(3) of the\nRegulations\n;\n(2) a vote under s. 15 of the\nCode\n; and\n(3) an Order-in-Council under s. 79 of the\nIndian Act\n.", "100": "[100]\nJustice Teitelbaum stated in\nJock\n, supra, that \"[w]here the law provides another remedy, quo warranto may not be used to contest an election\". However, he further stated that \"[a]ccording to Dussault and Borgeat (supra), the court has discretion to determine 'the appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted' (p. 388)\". In my view, in the circumstances of the case at bar, it is not appropriate to have required the applicant to have exhausted this internal relief avenue. Assuming the applicant had been successful in attaining a vote of 65% in favour of removing the respondent Hall from office, it is quite likely the applicant would still be in the position he is today, since the efficacy of this remedy depends upon the Band Council calling a new election. The applicant had already succeeded in obtaining an order of the Elections Appeal Board that a new general election be held. This order was not being complied with. I am of the view the applicant cannot be faulted for failing to exhaust this remedial avenue.", "088": "[88]\nFollowing the election, it is fair to say that the applicant acted promptly in submitting his appeal to the Election Appeal Board, at which time he did challenge the respondent's eligibility to hold office as Chief. The applicant submitted his written appeal dated March 18, 1994, only four days following the election. The question arises: does the applicant's prompt response to the respondent Hall's election as Band Chief rectify the applicant's acquiescence in the respondent Hall's candidacy for office? I am of the view that it does not.", "068": "[68]\nSecondly, although the\nCode\nprovides for the creation of an Elections Appeal Board, it is the\nRegulations\nthat confer powers upon this Board. Thus, in the absence of these\nRegulations\n, the Elections Appeal Board has limited power.", "091": "[91]\nAccording to the rules enunciated by Justice Teitelbaum in\nJock\n, supra, the following three factors are within the discretion of the court.\n7. Standing Of The Applicant", "030": "[30]\nSection 2(1) of the\nIndian Act\ndefines \"council of the band\", as meaning:\n\"(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established pursuant to that section;\n\"(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen according to the custom of the band, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band;\"", "060": "[60]\nIn summary, if s. 2(3) applies in this context, which I concluded, supra, it does not, then not only would it apply when the Band attempts to embody the custom in a written document, but it would apply to\nany\nexercise of the power. Thus, the respondents' find themselves in a difficult position. Their reasoning, when consistently applied, does not support their submissions.", "051": "[51]\nIn addition, the alleged final version of the\nCode\n, contained in Exhibit G of the applicant's affidavit, is dated July, 1993. This suggests that this version, which contains the residency clause, was in existence at least prior to the second plebiscite.", "036": "[36]\nIt is not disputed that the first plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993. The results of the plebiscite were: 128 in favour and 71 against. [see footnote 17] As the number of votes in favour did not constitute a majority of the total number of eligible voters, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993, the results of which were: 13 in favour; two against; and one spoiled ballot. [see footnote 18] Thus, since a simple majority of the total number of votes cast at the second plebiscite was in favour, the Department's policy enunciated, supra, was complied with.", "004": "[4]\nIn accordance with the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs' (the \"Department\") policy with respect to reversion to a custom system of elections, a plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993, for the purpose of demonstrating the support of the Band membership for a repeal of the s. 74 ministerial order and for an election system to be subsequently employed. A majority of voters in that plebiscite voted in favour of the proposal. However, as fewer than a majority of the total eligible voters voted in the first plebiscite, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993. Again, the majority of voters were in favour of the proposal. Notice of both plebiscites was posted at various locations throughout the Reserve. Only those Band members who resided on the Reserve were permitted to vote in the plebiscites. [see footnote 2]", "096": "[96]\nJustice Teitelbaum in\nJock\n, supra, stated that \"where the law provides another remedy, quo warranto may not be used to contest any election\". (\nJock\n, at p. 374) The applicant in the case at bar did use the appeal mechanism provided for by the\nCode\n, however the respondents have refused to abide by the order of the Election Appeal Board.", "092": "[92]\nAs the applicant is a member of the Band, lives on the Reserve, and was a candidate in the election, I find that he has sufficient interest in the matter to have standing.\n8. Length Of Time Since Election", "025": "[25]\nI agree with the respondents' submission that the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\nare \"nothing more than an attempt to put down in some kind of recognizable and written form the electoral practices of this particular Band\". [see footnote 16] There is no requirement under the\nIndian Act\nthat a Band reduce to writing its custom with respect to the selection of the Band's Council. By way of example, if the Band's custom was simply that the eldest child of a Chief or Councillor inherited the position upon the Chief or Councillor's death, it may not be necessary to write this custom into a code or bylaw: such a custom could easily be passed from generation to generation by word-of-mouth. However, the custom of the Band in the case at bar is not so simple, and accordingly the Band has seen fit to formulate a written\nCode\nand\nRegulations\nsetting out the Band's custom for choosing the Band's Council. The dispute that has arisen is whether or not the\nCode\nand\nRegulations\nso developed do indeed reflect the custom of the Band.", "001": "[1]\nHeald, D.J.\n: This is an application for judicial review for the purpose of obtaining, inter alia the following relief:\n\"1.

Facts", "016": "[16]\nThis argument of the applicant is flawed in two respects. Firstly, when the\nJock\ndecision was rendered, in 1991, s. 18.1 was not even in existence; the section came into force on February 1, 1992. Prior to this, the\nAct\ndid not impose a limitation period in relation to judicial review applications before the Trial Division. Secondly, pursuant to s. 18(3), the remedy of quo warranto may only be obtained by an application for judicial review brought under s. 18.1. Accordingly, it cannot be said that quo warranto is available under s. 18, independent of the constraints of s. 18.1, as was submitted by the applicant.", "072": "[72]\nIn summary, I am of the view that the\nRegulations\nwere enacted ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Band Council, as there is no evidence they were submitted to the community for approval, as is required by the enabling provision in the\nCode\n. I have the further view that the order of the Elections Appeal Board declaring a new general election be held is invalid. I so conclude because, in the absence of an empowering regulation, the Election Appeals Board is without jurisdiction to grant such an order.\n4. Should The Respondent Ron Hall\nBe Removed From The Office Of\nThe Chief Of The Sioux Valley\nIndian Band By The Issuance Of A Writ Of Quo Warranto?", "003": "[3]\nPrior to March 14, 1994, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the\nIndian Band Council Election Order\nof the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs (the \"Minister\"), dated December 14, 1989, s. 74 of the\nAct\napplied to the Band, and thus per s. 2(1) of the\nAct\n, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the\nIndian Act\n. However, for approximately 20-24 months prior to the March 14, 1994, elections, the Band considered reverting to a set of election procedures based on Band custom. [see footnote 1]", "007": "[7]\nOn February 28, 1994, the Band held a nomination meeting, and the applicant and the respondent Hall were nominated for the office of Band Chief. No person objected to the nomination of the respondent Hall for the office of Chief at this nomination meeting and at no time prior to the election. [see footnote 7] On March 14, 1994, elections were held for the positions of Band Chief and for five Band Councillors. The respondent Hall was elected to the office of Band Chief [see footnote 8], a position the applicant had held for the previous eight years.

How could she have answered that question if she had not heard what was going on? I find that Mrs. Zeid has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that her failure to report the currency was not deliberate.", "050": "[50]\nThat being said, I agree with the defendant that the lack of any intention to circumvent the reporting requirement or to deceive Customs officials is not relevant to the determination of whether or not the obligation to report has been contravened.

Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate to seek guidance for the interpretation of the provisions of the\nPCMLTFA\nat issue from the jurisprudence that has interpreted the analogous provisions in the\nCustoms\nAct\n.", "041": "[41]\nI also note that there were inconsistencies between her story and her son's as to the length of their planned trip to the United States, their purposes in going there and to whom the money belonged.", "031": "[31]\nSpecifically, section 25 of the\nPCMLTFA\npermits either the person from whom the currency was seized under section 18 or the lawful owner of the currency to request a decision of the Minister as to whether subsection 12(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nwas contravened, provided such a request is made in writing within 90 days after the date of the seizure.", "018": "[18]\nOn July 4, 2006, the plaintiff commenced the present statutory appeal by way of action by having a statement of claim issued in this Court pursuant to section 30 of the\nPCMLTFA\n.", "040": "[40]\nFirst of all, it is difficult to believe, as the plaintiff would have it, that the money she was carrying was her \"savings\" and that she takes it with her whenever she leaves her house. Why, if that is the case, would she have precisely $10,000.00 in her money belt and $2,500.00 (all in $50.00 notes) in her purse? Why would a large proportion of her \"savings\" be in American dollars? Why would she split her \"savings\" in three different locations, that is, in her purse, in a money belt on her abdomen and in an envelope on her chest? That story, in and of itself, stretches the imagination.", "045": "[45]\nMrs. Zeid pretends she was not paying attention when the Custom official asked questions to her son. Again, this claim is most difficult to believe, especially after having just been refused entry to the United States. How could she not be interested by what was going on? In any event, she must have heard what the Custom official was saying as she handed her driving license to her son when asked for identification of the passenger. How could she then not hear the Custom official asking if any of them had purchased anything from the Canadian duty free store, if either of them had any commercial or business goods, or if either of them had any currency or monetary instruments valued at over $10,000.00? This affidavit evidence given by the Custom official was not challenged by way of cross-examination.", "042": "[42]\nMore importantly, the plaintiff has not shown on a balance of probabilities that she did not know of her obligation to report currency in excess of $10,000.00 or that she did not hear the Custom officer asking if they had any currency or monetary instruments valued at over $10,000.00 at the Custom booth.", "024": "[24]\nThe objectives of the\nPCMLTFA\nare clearly set out in the statute.

She argues that the Court is entitled to consider whether or not there was a deliberate and knowledgeable contravention of the cross-border currency reporting requirements in respect of the Currency to determine if she was in contravention of section 12 of the\nPCMLTFA.", "029": "[29]\nFurthermore, section 23 of the\nPCMLTFA\nprovides that currency seized as forfeit pursuant to subsection 18(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nis automatically forfeited to Her Majesty in Right of Canada from the time of the contravention of subsection 12(1) in respect of which it was seized, and no act or proceeding after the forfeiture is necessary to effect the forfeiture.", "057": "[57]\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that this appeal must be dismissed, with costs. In light of the plaintiff's admission that she did not report the Currency to Canadian Customs officials on August 28, 2005, either when she exported it to the United States or when she imported it back into Canada, there is no doubt that the defendant was correct to decide that subsection 12(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nhad been contravened in the case at bar.\nJUDGMENT", "023": "[23]\nOn the other hand, the defendant's position is that the plaintiff cannot establish factually, on a balance of probabilities, that her failure to report the Currency was unintentional.

At the prevailing exchange rate, the total value of the Currency was approximately $19,468.27 Canadian dollars.", "026": "[26]\nThe relevant reporting requirements in the case at bar (which involved both an exportation and an importation of currency) stem from subsections 12(1) and 12(3)(a) of the\nPCMLTFA\nalong with sections 2, 3, 4 and 11 of the\nCross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations\n, SOR/2002-412.

That person is then entitled, pursuant to subsection 26(2) of the\nPCMLTFA\n, to provide any evidence in the matter that he or she desires to furnish, provided he or she does so within 30 days of receiving the Commissioner's written notice. The Minister must then, pursuant to section 27 of the\nPCMLTFA\n, make a decision with respect to whether subsection 12(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nwas contravened.

I shall, nevertheless, venture the following comments.", "054": "[54]\nPerhaps the clearest statement of this principle is that penned by Mr. Justice Pinard in\nHe et al. v.

The issue for the Court is simply whether the goods ... were, in fact and law, liable to forfeiture. The\nAct\ncreates a voluntary reporting legislative framework in which importers must accurately declare all goods, must accurately account for the quantity and value of the goods, and must pay the duty and taxes attracted by all goods imported. (...) Therefore, the\nAct\nis contravened when an incorrect declaration is made by or on behalf of an importer. Furthermore, the source of that error is irrelevant. The importer is liable for having failed to meet the obligation to accurately account for the goods which, from the time of the contravention, are forfeit to the Crown. A lack of intention on the part of the importer to evade duty and taxes is irrelevant in a seizure proceeding. Neither the lack of intent to mislead Customs, nor the presence of an inadvertent error in reporting goods, affects the validity of a seizure.\"", "017": "[17]\nThe plaintiff then requested a decision of the defendant as to whether subsection 12(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nhad been contravened, pursuant to section 25 of the\nPCMLTFA\n. Such a decision was rendered on March 31, 2006, pursuant to section 27 of the\nPCMLTFA\n. Specifically, the defendant determined that subsection 12(1) of the\nPCMLTFA\nhad indeed been contravened by the plaintiff as a result of her failure to report the Currency to Customs officials.", "015": "[15]\nIn addition, as Customs officials felt they had reasonable grounds to suspect that the Currency was proceeds of crime, they decided not to return it to the plaintiff pursuant to subsection 18(2) of the\nPCMLTFA\n.", "010": "[10]\nJust prior to the arrival of the plaintiff and her son at the Canadian border crossing, the Canadian Customs official had been given a Lookout Synopsis prepared by the Intelligence Division of the Canada Border Services Agency.

It was then decided to frisk both of them for the safety of the officials. When her purse was searched for possible weapons, $2,500.00 was found in the side pocket. At that point, Mrs. Zeid was asked if she had any other money in the vehicle, in her purse or on her before the search was continued, to which she stated \"No\". This is the affidavit evidence of three Custom officials who were present in the interview room where all this happened, and as already mentioned they were not cross-examined by the plaintiff. Indeed, she signed the partial agreed statement of facts, paragraph 8 of which (paragraph 11 of these reasons) confirms this version of the events.", "013": "[13]\nA count performed by Customs officials revealed that the envelope in fact contained $USD 7,910.00 American dollars and the money belt contained $CAD 10,000.00 Canadian dollars.", "039": "[39]\nThe plaintiff's contention that she was unaware of her obligation to report the currency in her possession when she crossed the border is not borne out by the evidence; indeed, the uncontradicted affidavit evidence of several Custom officials shows that her attitude bordered on wilful blindness.", "056": "[56]\nThis is indeed the conclusion reached by my colleagues in the only two cases that have dealt with this issue so far. In\nTourki\nv.\nCanada\n(Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)\n, supra, Justice Harrington rejected Mr. Tourki's argument that his lack of awareness of the obligation to declare would warrant overturning the Minister's decision that he had contravened subsection 12(1). Similarly, Justice Kelen recognized the irrelevance of the traveller's subjective intention when failing to report cross-border currency, further to a motion for summary judgment brought by the Minister in respect of a section 30\nPCMLTFA\nstatutory appeal:\nHoang v. Minister of National Revenue et al.\n(2006), 287 F.T.R. 103; 2006 FC 182.

The Currency was not reported to Canada Customs when it was exported to the United States.", "043": "[43]\nWhen cross-examined by counsel for the defendant, the plaintiff acknowledged that she travelled to the Middle East on six or seven occasions since arriving in Canada in 1973, and that she also went to the United States five or six times during that same period of time. While it may have been the first time she went abroad since the coming into force of the\nPCMLTFA\nin January 2003, she testified that she knows she has to answer questions asked by Custom officials truthfully. She may in fact have learned the hard way since it appears Mrs. Zeid had her jewellery seized upon returning from the Middle East in 1986, as a result of not reporting it to Custom officials at Pearson Airport.", "020": "[20]\nThe plaintiff admits that the Currency in her possession on August 28, 2005 was not reported to Canadian Customs officials when she imported it back into Canada.\nII.

She submits that she was unaware of the statutory requirement to report and that she had no intention to mislead custom officials.", "048": "[48]\nAt the hearing, however, she purported to change her version of what happened while being examined by her counsel. She testified that she never answered \"No\" when asked by a Custom official whether she had any other money on her, and that she only answered in the negative to the question whether she had any other money in the vehicle. Needless to say, this denial flatly contradicts the partial agreed statement of facts that she signed, and at that stage her lawyer, clearly surprised by her statement, could do no better than putting an end to his examination.", "053": "[53]\nThat jurisprudence makes it abundantly clear that a traveller's subjective intention when failing to report is irrelevant. It has been unequivocally held that such intention is not required since the system is one of voluntary reporting and because strict liability attaches to those who fail to report.", "049": "[49]\nIn light of all the evidence before the Court, and of the less than truthful manner in which the plaintiff testified before the Court, I am drawn to the inescapable conclusion that Mrs. Zeid either knew of the reporting requirement or, at the very least, did everything possible to avoid having to answer the Customs official's questions. There is no doubt in my mind that wilful blindness can not be countenanced and is as reprehensible as an outright lie.", "011": "[11]\nThe Canadian Customs official then referred the plaintiff and her son to a secondary examination. During the course of this examination, the plaintiff's purse was searched, revealing $2,500.00 Canadian Dollars. The plaintiff was then asked by a Customs official whether she had any other money on her or in the vehicle. The plaintiff answered \"no\".", "034": "[34]\nIf, on the other hand, the Minister decides that there was a failure to report, the Minister must then render a second decision, as per section 29 of the\nPCMLTFA\n, with respect to the appropriate sanction for the infraction. This decision is effectively a review of the quantum of the sanction imposed by the Customs official pursuant to subsection 18(2) (i.e., full forfeiture or a penalty ranging from $250.00 to $5,000.00). Section 29 of the\nPCMLTFA\nrequires the Minister to either confirm the Customs official's decision with respect to the sanction or to reduce it to some lesser penalty.

The plaintiff also indicated that she had $10,000.00 underneath her clothes and voluntarily removed a money belt she had secured underneath her clothing in the area of her waist. When asked how much money was in the envelope, the plaintiff initially stated she did not know and then said there was \"about $7,600.00\".", "028": "[28]\nPursuant to subsection 18(2) of the\nPCMLTFA\n, the Customs official must then decide whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the currency is proceeds of crime or funds for terrorist financing. If the official answers to this question are in the affirmative, the seized currency must remain as forfeit. If the official answers to this question in the negative, he or she must return the currency upon receipt of the prescribed penalty, which ranges from $250.00 to $5,000.00.", "030": "[30]\nAs per section 24 of the\nPCMLTFA\n, the forfeiture of seized currency is final and is not subject to review or to be set aside or otherwise dealt with except to the extent and in the manner provided by sections 25 to 30 of the\nPCMLTFA\n, which sets out the review and appeal procedure with respect to forfeitures effected under Part 2 of the\nPCMLTFA\n.", "051": "[51]\nAs has been recognized by the jurisprudence of this Court, it is evident that Parliament intended that the seizure, review and appeal mechanisms in the\nPCMLTFA\nmirror and complement those found in the\nCustoms\nAct\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1.

In the mouths of the doctors the statement that the injury was \"assumed\" to relate to the 1983-1984 event; or that the doctor \"feels\" it is \"probably\" the result of the 1984 injury, is speculation. Neither doctor had any first hand knowledge of the events; they were not treating the applicant in 1983-1984, and had not even been doing so at the commencement of his complaints in 1987-1988. Neither doctor in 1996 had any basis other than the applicant's recitation of events on which to base a conclusion as to the event that caused the injury. And, as noted, the applicant's description of the 1983-1984 event as constituting a cause of injury is contradicted by documentary evidence, signed by him in 1984.", "019": "[19]\nEach decision respecting the applicant's application for a disability pension denied the application on the ground that there was no medical documentation in the 1983-1984 period attesting to an injury or complaint. While the applicant correctly asserts that uncontradicted evidence by him should be accepted unless a lack of credibility finding is made, and that every reasonable inference should be drawn, and any reasonable doubt resolved in his favour, he still has the obligation to demonstrate that the medical difficulty from which he now suffers arose out of or in connection with his military service; that is, the causal linkage must be established.", "022": "[22]\nAlso, the applicant's attempt to explain the medical statement that he signed, saying no injury had been suffered, is not very convincing. He said that he thought that someone may have changed the form after he signed it, perhaps to play a joke. He asserts that the change was not in his handwriting. However, while the change to the form may not be in his handwriting, it does not follow that the change was not made before he signed the form. Also, the absence of any medical examination on his file is consistent with the negative assertion on the Medical Statement.", "029": "[29]\nFor the reasons given the application must be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.", "023": "[23]\nThe Board had before it: the applicant's evidence concerning his fall into the crevasse; his assertion that he reported this as a service injury on discharge for which assertion there is no supporting documentary evidence and indeed documentary evidence that contradicts it; his evidence that he sought medical attention in 1987-1988 from his family doctor who took x-rays, which x-rays the applicant states he imagines \"were destroyed long ago\"; the more recent 1996 medical evidence of Drs. Pietrangelo and Lovell who attest to the present neck problems from which the applicant suffers but whose evidence concerning the initial cause thereof can come only from the applicant's description of the events that occurred. The Board weighed this evidence and found it could not conclude that the applicant's present problems were related to the events of 1983-1984.", "014": "[14]\nThe decision dated September 5, 1997, by the Board on reconsidering its earlier decision in the applicant's case reads in part:\n\"This Board cannot agree with that argument presented by the Advocate.

This Board did not view any Reports on Injuries or any documentation of any kind which indicated any injury or complaints of injury during Regular Force service.\n\"In once more reviewing the whole of this application as required by this application for reconsideration,\nthis Board maintains that Dr. Lovell's opinion is not supported by x-ray documentation and is based on historical information provided by the applicant\n.\n\"In other words, this Board is of the opinion that\nDr. Lovell's letter of 20 December 1996 and the opinion contained therein cannot be supported by the Record\n.\" (underlining added)\nApplicant's Arguments", "005": "[5]\nThe Medical Statement signed on discharge requires an outgoing member to state whether or not he or she has sustained an injury attributable to service by either striking out the word(s) \"have\" or \"have not\" that precede the words \"suffered an injury\" on the form. The applicant's form shows that the words \"have not\" are struck out, but the word \"not\" has been inserted in handwriting, uninitialled and undated, behind the word \"have\". The form thus reads \"I ... have not suffered an injury ...\". The applicant denies having inserted the word \"not\". The Medical Statement form also states that where an affirmative answer is given to the question of whether an injury was suffered, a medical examination is required. As noted, there is no medical examination report on the applicant's military record.", "026": "[26]\nCounsel for the respondent argues that the Board's statement that Dr. Lovell's opinion was not supported by x-ray documentation must be read in the context of the rest of the text of that decision and the previous Board decisions, and that the Board was referring to the lack of x-rays from 1983-1984. Counsel's written argument reads:\n\"It is clear from the Appeal Panel's reasons that it is not stating that no x-ray evidence was presented. What the Appeal Panel found was that there was no x-ray documenting that the origin of the injury occurred in 1983/1984. Indeed, the applicant's evidence was that x-rays were not taken until many years after his discharge from the forces ...\"", "021": "[21]\nAn often quoted principle used in evaluating evidence is that greater weight is generally given to statements made prior to a legal claim being made than to those made at the time of the claim, or in contemplation of the claim. The earlier statements will not likely have been framed with the subsequent claim in mind. I am not saying that the applicant's evidence is not true, but only that the decision-makers below had the unenviable job of evaluating his 1995 evidence concerning the cause of the injury with the documentary evidence from 1984.

Furthermore, there is no record of the extent of such an injury indicating possible future consequences. The applicant sought medical help for the condition some four year [sic] following the injury and it wasn't until January 1996 that the diagnosis is made by a medical doctor some twelve years following the reported injury.\n. . . . .\n\"The Panel considered all of the medical evidence and opinions presented to it, along with the detailed statement submitted by the applicant. In conclusion,\nthe Panel has no medical advice or opinion of the occurrence or extent of an injury to the applicant during the winter exercise in 1983/1984. The fact that his seeking medical attention in 1987-1988 suggest that the disability is post-discharge in origin and not related to his Reserve Force service\n.\" (underlining added)", "008": "[8]\nThe applicant's physician, Dr. R.

Immediately following his accident he had minor neck complaints that cleared up and did not really start to bother him until approximately one year later. Since that time he has been complaining of neck pain that over time requires a visit to the chiropractor approximately every two weeks to relieve this pain. He has no family history of arthritis, nor any evidence of arthritis elsewhere.\n\"\nCervical spine x-ray\nshowed osteophyte formation at C4-5 and C6 with the rest of the x-ray being reported as normal.\nThese signs of arthritis\nof the cervical spine which in the absence of any other sign of arthritis elsewhere\nwould lead one to think that this is a condition brought on by his accident since he denies any other injuries to his neck\n.\n\"In summary,\nI fell Mr. Hall suffers from mild arthritis to the cervical spine probably as a result of his neck injury in 1984\n.\" (underlining added)\nDecisions", "013": "[13]\nIn the\nMacKay\ncase the Board had refused to consider, on a reconsideration hearing, new medical evidence that was sought to be adduced. Mr. Justice Teitelbaum held that under the applicable legislation the Board had an obligation to consider such evidence.

Canada (Attorney General)\n(1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.). The principle drawn from\nMoar\nwas that unless the medical evidence is found not to be credible it must be accepted by the Board, if uncontradicted; if found not credible, reasons must be given for that finding.", "006": "[6]\nThe applicant states that he did not seek medical attention for his injury until 1987-1988, that is four years after the accident. He states that his family physician took x-rays at that time but these x-rays were not available at the time of his application for a pension in 1995. X-rays were also apparently taken in 1992, by a chiropractor that was then treating the applicant. The applicant states that he has these in his possession and they were presented to the Board.", "020": "[20]\nThe evidence supporting a causal linkage between the 1983-1984 events and the later problem, however, is the applicant's own evidence and this evidence is not uncontradicted. It is contradicted by the 1984 documentary evidence: the Medical Statement that the applicant signed on discharge. That document states that he did not suffer an injury attributable to his military service during the relevant period.", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant filed an application for a disability pension with the Department of Veterans Affairs on October 19, 1995. That application was refused by the Minister on September 4, 1996. An entitlement review hearing was held by a review panel of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board on January 22, 1997; the application for the pension was refused. An entitlement appeal before an appeal panel of the Board was held on June 9, 1997; the refusal was confirmed. The appeal panel of the Board reconsidered its June 9, 1997 decision on September 5, 1997. That reconsideration again resulted in the refusal of a pension. It is that decision to which this application relates.\nFacts", "011": "[11]\nThe decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board at the entitlement appeal level, dated June 9, 1997, confirming the Review decision, reads, in part:\n. . . . .\n\"This Board, based on the evidence before it, is unable to conclude that the claimed condition of cervical disc disease is attributable to or was incurred during Mr. Hall's relatively short, one year Reserve Force service. This Board is satisfied that the Entitlement Board decision is appropriate and can find no basis to disturb it.\n\"While this Board is sympathetic to Mr. Hall's situation, it is unable to conclude that the condition or any aggravation thereof is pensionable.\n\"The evidence before this Board indicates that Mr. Hall's recorded condition of 'cervical disc disease' was indeed diagnosed by a doctor of chiropractic, Dr. Pietrangelo on 11 January 1996 as 'chronic cervical strain resulting in mechanical neck pain from joint dysfunction and associated muscle spasm' and by Dr. Lovell on 20 December as 'mild arthritis to the cervical spine probably as a result of his neck injury in 1984'.\n\"When Mr. Hall appeared before his Entitlement Review Board in Windsor, Ontario on 22 January 1987 [sic] he indicated that when he was released from militia service, he filed a medical statement regarding his neck injury. As noted also by that Board, this medical statement could not be found in any of Mr. Hall's release documents. [sic: the medical statement was among the release documents; a medical examination consequent on declaration of an injury was not].\n\"\nAlso obvious to this board is that the diagnosis, referred to earlier in this decision, is not supported by any x-rays\n.\n\"This Board is faced with no evidence to support an award of pension. There is no indication of any symptoms or complaints during Mr. Hall's Reserve Force service and there is no reports of injury documented during this same period of time.\n\"\nAs for the contention by the Advocate that the evidence presented before the Entitlement Review Board raised a reasonable doubt that the claimed condition is related to an injury sustained in the course of Mr. Hatt's Reserve Force service, this Board is of the opinion that in the absence of any supporting medical evidence on the record, it finds that the medical opinion found on the file simply raises a possibility. It is the opinion of this Board that these medical evaluations are simply speculation which, regrettably, is not sufficient under the circumstances to create a doubt in the mind of this Board that the claimed condition of cervical disc disease is related to an incident in 1983-1984\n.\" (underlining added)", "009": "[9]\nAs noted, the Minister's decision of September 4, 1996, refused the applicant's application for a disability pension. It reads in part:\n\"A review of your service documents did not reveal any complaints or abnormal findings with regards to your neck during your period of service with Reserve Force Service. There were no Reports on Injury documented during your period of Reserve Force Service.\n\"The first indication of a neck problem was recorded on a Physician's Statement dated January 1996 that recorded a diagnosis of arthritis of neck.\n\"\nWith no documentation of a Report on Injury or any neck complaints recorded during your Reserve Force, the Department has concluded that your cervical disc disease diagnosed in 1996, is post discharge in origin\nand therefore not pensionable under s. 21(2).\n. . . . .\n\"In making its decision, the Department has considered and applied the provisions of s. 5(3) which provides that any doubt in weighing uncontradicted, credible evidence presented shall be resolved in the applicant's favour.\" (underlining added)", "012": "[12]\nThe applicant sought a reconsideration of this decision by the Board. Reconsideration was sought on the ground that the panel had erred in concluding that the medical evidence simply raised a possibility that the incident caused his condition. The applicant noted that the medical reports he had filed had used the word \"probably\". He argued that any doubt about his claim should therefore have been resolved in his favour. The applicant referred particularly to Mr. Justice Teitelbaum's decision in\nMacKay v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1997), 129 F.T.R. 286 (T.D.). That decision dealt with an individual who claimed a disability pension as a result of a whiplash injury that had occurred 30 years prior to the initial medical evidence that was relied upon.", "028": "[28]\nOn reflection, I have decided that even if the applicant's interpretation of the Board's statements concerning a lack of x-ray documentation is correct, it would not assist the applicant, in the end, because he still has not proven causation. If the Board's reference is to the 1995-1996 diagnosis, then, it relates to the extent of the applicant's present disability and that prognosis. It does not relate to the linkage between his present disability and events occurring during his military service. It is the inability to prove this linkage that is the main reason for the Board's refusal to grant the applicant a disability pension.", "004": "[4]\nThe applicant did not report the accident nor seek medical attention at the time. He states that at the time of discharge he signed a written medical statement that he had suffered an injury attributable to his service. He states that this would have given rise to a medical examination which documentation cannot now be found on his file.", "025": "[25]\nOne aspect of the decision, however, that does give rise to some uncertainty is the assertion by the Board that: \"this Board maintains that Dr. Lovell's opinion is not supported by x-ray documentation ...\". While the applicant appears not to have attempted to file the 1987-1988 x-rays, he states that the x-rays from 1992 were filed by Dr. Pietrangelo and were subsequently returned to him. Also the applicant asserts that Dr. Lovell took x-rays in 1996 as part of his diagnostic procedure. Dr. Lovell makes reference to x-rays in his report to the Board.", "001": "[1]\nReed, J.\n: The applicant brings an application under s. 18.1 of the\nFederal Court Act\nfor the review of a decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, dated September 5, 1997. That decision reconfirmed an earlier decision by the Board refusing his application for a veteran's disability pension.\nBackground\nProcedural History", "016": "[16]\nWith respect to giving the applicant the benefit of every reasonable inference, the applicant notes that it was emphasized by Mr. Justice Campbell in\nKing v. Veterans Review and Appeal Board (Can.)\n(1997), 138 F.T.R. 15 (T.D.), at page 10, that the Board was obliged to accept uncontradicted evidence presented to it by an applicant.\nStatutory Provisions", "003": "[3]\nThe applicant served in the Armed Forces Primary Reserve from November 24, 1983 to December 6, 1984. He was a member of the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa regiment. During winter training in 1983-1984 he fell through the surface of deep snow into a crevasse. He was carrying a heavy radio backpack secured with a waistband and headband. He states that the fall caused his backpack to shift and the headband snapped his neck backward and sideways resulting in a whiplash type injury.", "007": "[7]\nThe earliest available medical report presented to the Board to establish the applicant's condition is that of a chiropractor, Dr. D. Pietrangelo. He prepared a statement on January 11, 1996, containing the diagnosis: \"Chronic cervical strain resulting in mechanical neck pain from joint dysfunction and associated muscle spasm\". This was followed by a written report, dated December 19, 1996. The applicant states that Dr. Pietrangelo filed the 1992 x-rays with his report and these were subsequently returned. The December 1996 report reads as follows:\n\"Further to my report of findings as regard Mr. Hall dated January 11, 1996. In my opinion this patients cervical disc disease condition which results in chronically recurring symptoms\nis the result of an old 'whiplash' type injury to the neck and would have occurred at least 10 years ago\n.\n\"Other than the neck injuries sustained while on Reserve Force activities, Mr. Hall denies any history of neck trauma, i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, etc. This being the case\nI would therefore assume that the patient's neck condition is probably the result of his fall and injury while serving in the Reserve Force in the winter of 1983-1984\n.\" (underlining added)"}, "decision": "that statements by doctors about the cause of the applicant's injury in that case were not credible, since the doctors involved had no basis other than the applicant's recitation of events on which to base a conclusion as to the event that caused the injury, and since the applicant's description of the event was contradicted by documentary evidence which he had signed upon his discharge from military service."}, "460": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nEvidence tendered by a witness with a personal interest in the matter may also be examined for its weight before considering its credibility because typically this sort of evidence requires corroboration if it is to have probative value. If there is no corroboration, then it may be unnecessary to assess its credibility as its weight will not meet the legal burden of proving the fact on the balance of probabilities. When the trier of fact assesses the evidence in this manner he or she is not making a determination based on the credibility of the person providing the evidence; rather, the trier of fact is simply saying the evidence that has been tendered does not have sufficient probative value, either on its own or coupled with the other tendered evidence, to establish on the balance of probability, the fact for which it has been tendered. That, in my view, is the assessment the officer made in this case.", "033": "[33]\nThe weight the trier of fact gives evidence tendered in a proceeding is not a science. Persons may weigh evidence differently but there is a reasonable range of weight within which the assessment of the evidence's weight should fall. Deference must be given to PRRA officers in their assessment of the probative value of evidence before them. If it falls within the range of reasonableness, it should not be disturbed. In my view the weight given counsel's statement in this matter falls within that range.", "037": "[37]\nAt the hearing the parties requested an opportunity to consider their positions and, if advised, make submissions on a certified question. Accordingly, within 15 days of the issue of these Reasons, either or both counsel may submit a draft of any question proposed to be certified. The Court will reserve the right to endorse any such question and incorporate it or them into the formal Judgment.", "031": "[31]\nAccepting that counsel may submit evidence directly to the PRRA officer, the question will always remain, as it does for all tendered evidence, as to the degree of weight to be given to that evidence. As with all evidence tendered by an applicant in an administrative proceeding, the weight to be given to statements will depend very much on the nature of the statement, the materiality of the fact stated to the matters in issue, and the nature of the proceeding itself. A statement from counsel as to the client's sexual orientation is entitled to be given no more and no less weight than if it were made in an unsworn statement by the Applicant herself.", "018": "[18]\nMs. Carrillo is a citizen of Mexico who sought refugee protection in Canada. She claimed that she had been abused by her common-law spouse and that her spouse's brother, a police officer, had helped her spouse find her when she hid after the beating. The principal issue before the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board was whether state protection was available to Ms. Carrillo in Mexico. Her refugee claim was dismissed by the Board. It found that she was not a credible or trustworthy witness with respect to her efforts to seek state protection in Mexico. Further, the Board held that had it found her to be credible, she had nonetheless failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Federal Court set aside that decision on the basis that the Board imposed too high a standard of proof on Ms. Carrillo regarding the lack of state protection. An appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal was allowed.", "024": "[24]\nThe determination of whether the evidence presented meets the legal burden will depend very much on the weight given to the evidence that has been presented.", "019": "[19]\nThe Court of Appeal, in the course of its reasons, engaged in a detailed and informative discussion of the concepts of burden of proof, standard of proof, and quality of the evidence necessary to meet the burden of proof, all of which I find to be very useful in the present case and which, in my view, ought to be kept in mind by PRRA officers when considering applications.", "022": "[22]\nThe standard of proof in civil matters and in administrative processes is the balance of probabilities. In this PRRA application the Applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be subject to risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Jamaica. That is proved by presenting evidence to the officer. In this respect the Applicant also has an evidentiary burden. The Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of each of the facts that has to be proved. One of those facts involves her sexual orientation. As will be discussed below, I hold that she did present some evidence of her sexual orientation and thus can be said to have met her evidentiary burden - she presented evidence of each material fact in issue.", "029": "[29]\nI take issue with the position of the Respondent in its memorandum of argument that a statement made by counsel can never be evidence and thus, presumably, can never be found to have any probative value. Legal counsel are officers of the Court with well established duties and responsibilities, including the responsibility not to misstate facts or mislead. In my view, statements of fact made by counsel may constitute evidence in informal proceedings such as a PRRA application and they may be given weight. In these instances, counsel is not the witness, it is counsel's client that is the effective witness - counsel is merely making a statement on the client's behalf.", "023": "[23]\nAs the Court of Appeal pointed out in\nCarrillo\nnot all evidence is of the same quality. Accordingly, while an applicant may have met the evidentiary burden because evidence of each essential fact has been presented, he may not have met the legal burden because the evidence presented does not prove the facts required on the balance of probabilities. The legal burden of proof is met, in this case, when the Applicant proves to the officer, on the balance of probabilities, that she is lesbian.", "014": "[14]\nWith respect, in my view, that form letter makes it clear that the submissions are to set out reasons and explanations -not evidence. Evidence to support the application ought to be contained in or referenced in the application. In this instance, the Applicant's statement on the face of her application that submissions were to follow may have been sufficient to alert the officer that those submissions might also contain evidence in addition to reasons and explanations. As will be discussed later, it is my view that there may be instances when statements from counsel may be considered to be evidence.", "005": "[5]\nBy letter dated July 25, 2007, Ms. Ferguson's former counsel wrote to the PRRA officer enclosing \"the evidence being relied upon by the Applicant and submissions in support of her application\". In addition to enclosing news articles, counsel provided a six-page document which appears to be the submissions referenced in the covering letter. Counsel writes:\nMs. Ferguson is lesbian and is very open about her sexual orientation. She believes that if removed to Jamaica, her life would be at risk, as a result of well-known incidences of homophobia and hate-crime violence in that country against members of her particular social group.\nThe only other reference to Ms. Ferguson's sexual orientation is found at the end of her former counsel's submissions where she writes:\nRespecting the fact that the objective documentary evidence reveals the persecution of members of the Applicant's particular social group is commonplace in Jamaica, and the fact that Ms. Ferguson is very openly lesbian, counsel respectfully submits that there is a very serious possibility that the Applicant would be at risk should she return to her country of nationality.", "026": "[26]\nIf the trier of fact finds that the evidence is credible, then an assessment must be made as to the weight that is to be given to it. It is not only evidence that has passed the test of reliability that may be assessed for weight. It is open to the trier of fact, in considering the evidence, to move immediately to an assessment of weight or probative value without considering whether it is credible. Invariably this occurs when the trier of fact is of the view that the answer to the first question is irrelevant because the evidence is to be given little or no weight, even if it is found to be reliable evidence. For example, evidence of third parties who have no means of independently verifying the facts to which they testify is likely to be ascribed little weight, whether it is credible or not.", "021": "[21]\nIn PRRA applications, it is the applicant who bears the burden of proof:\nBayavuge v.

Had the statement been affirmed by the Applicant in a sworn affidavit submitted with her application, it would have been deserving of somewhat greater weight than it was given. Had it been supported by other corroborative evidence such as evidence from her lesbian partner(s), public statements, and the like, it would have attracted even more weight.", "017": "[17]\nIn my view, the approach to be taken by both the officer and this Court, sitting in review, is to be guided by the principles set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in\nCarrillo v.

It is also common ground that the officer's decision establishes that the requirements in subsections (b) and (c) were met. The issue is whether the requirements set out in subsection 167(a) were met. The Applicant's position is that they were; the officer's rejection of her application was based on the rejection of her evidence that she was openly lesbian, and thus the decision rested on her credibility. The Respondent takes the position that the decision was not based on credibility, but rather on a finding that there was insufficient evidence presented to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that Ms. Ferguson was openly lesbian. In fact, in her written submission, the Respondent's counsel takes the position that there was no evidence before the PRRA officer regarding Ms. Ferguson's sexual orientation to doubt or believe, as her counsel's submission in this regard was not evidence.\nISSUE", "035": "[35]\nBased on the treatment homosexuals receive in Jamaica, as set out in the officer's decision, it is truly unfortunate if the Applicant is lesbian that she will be returned to Jamaica. However, every applicant for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment, and their counsel, must take responsibility to ensure that all of the relevant evidence is before the officer and, of equal importance, that they present the best evidence in support of the application. Where that is not done, the consequences of a failed application rest with the Applicant and counsel.", "013": "[13]\nIn response, the Applicant submitted that it is common practice for immigration counsel to file written submissions on behalf of clients which include statements of evidence, and that there is nothing in either the Act or Regulations or in the policy and procedures of the Respondent that would indicate that such evidence is not to be considered. It is further submitted that the letter from Citizenship and Immigration Canada advising Ms. Ferguson of her right to apply for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment states that information in written submissions will be considered by the PRRA officer. That form letter contains the following paragraph:\nYou may send us written submissions to support your application for protection. You may explain, in the submissions, the reasons why you think your removal to your country of nationality or habitual residence would put you at risk.", "006": "[6]\nThe officer charged with evaluating Ms. Ferguson's claim agreed, without reservation, on the basis of documentary evidence, that lesbians in Jamaica are at risk of severe physical abuse on account of their sexual orientation. The officer nonetheless dismissed the application on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Ms. Ferguson is lesbian. The officer wrote as follows:\nAside from the brief statement that the applicant is a \"lesbian and is very open about her sexual orientation\", I have not been provided with supporting evidence that establishes, on the balance of probabilities that, the applicant is a homosexual. Without sufficient evidence that the applicant is a lesbian, an assessment of current country conditions does not establish that she is personally at risk in Jamaica.\nThus, while independent research confirms violence against homosexuals in Jamaica, there is insufficient objective evidence before me to establish that the applicant is, on the balance of probabilities, a lesbian.", "020": "[20]\nIn every proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, one party has the burden of proof. Where the existence of a particular fact is at issue, uncertainty is resolved by asking whether or not the burden has been discharged with respect to that fact . This was eloquently stated by Lord Hoffmann in\nIn re B (Children) (FC)\n, [2008] UKHL 35 at paragraph 2:\nIf a legal rule requires a fact to be proved (a \"fact in issue\"), a judge or jury must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.", "002": "[2]\nFor the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that no hearing was required as the decision was based solely on the weight of the evidence presented and did not rest on the Applicant's credibility.\nBACKGROUND", "011": "[11]\nThe Applicant submitted that while the officer did not explicitly state that the decision was one of credibility, it could not be anything other than credibility. In the Applicant's submission, the officer did not believe her counsel's statement that she is an open lesbian. Her counsel writes in the memorandum of argument: \"Whether because the Applicant had failed to produce sufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities, or for any other reason, the PRRA officer has not believed the statement that the Applicant is a lesbian\". This, it is submitted, is essentially a finding of credibility that attracts the requirement to hold a hearing under section 167 of the Regulations. The Applicant further submits that the PRRA officer did not explain why the statement provided by the Applicant's former counsel was insufficient evidence or what evidence the officer did rely on to refute the statement that she was lesbian.", "034": "[34]\nIt is also my view that there is nothing in the officer's decision under review which would indicate that any part of it was based on the Applicant's credibility. The officer neither believes nor disbelieves that the Applicant is lesbian - he is unconvinced. He states that there is insufficient objective evidence to establish that she is lesbian.

First, he may assess whether the evidence is credible. When there is a finding that the evidence is not credible, it is in truth a finding that the source of the evidence is not reliable. Findings of credibility may be made on the basis that previous statements of the witness contradict or are inconsistent with the evidence now being offered (see for example\nKarimi,\nabove), or because the witness failed to tender this important evidence at an earlier opportunity, thus bringing into question whether it is a recent fabrication (see for example\nSidhu v. Canada\n2004 FC 39). Documentary evidence may also be found to be unreliable because its author is not credible. Self-serving reports may fall into this category.

If the Applicant is correct, then the PRRA officer ought to have held a hearing to determine her sexual orientation. If the Respondent is correct then no hearing was required.", "016": "[16]\nCounsel for both parties appeared to be of the same mind that, in the words of Respondent counsel, there is no principled approach to the issue of credibility versus sufficiency of evidence to be gleaned from these authorities. I do not share that view. Most of the cases to which the Court was referred were determined on the particular facts of the decision under review. In each instance the Court was required to make a determination as to whether, in the decision under review, \"there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility\", to use the words of section 167 of the Regulations. That, in turn, required an examination of the evidence before the officer and the officer's assessment of that evidence.

Dr. Arnott explained that doses of levofloxacin would appear more toxic when administered orally due to the fact that it is approximately ten times more soluble in water than ofloxacin and a greater amount is absorbed than when the drug is injected intravenously. The patent disclosure indicates that the acute toxicity results were \"determined in mice by intravenous administration\" and does not purport to offer toxicity data in relation to oral administration. While the data compiled in the product monographs for FLOXIN and LEVAQUIN appear to offer conflicting conclusions in relation to the oral dosages given to mice, the '080 patent does not purport to relate to such oral administration.", "081": "[81]\nDr. Klibanov's statements in his affidavit support the position that the exact properties of the S(-) isomer, compared to the R(+) enantiomer and racemic ofloxacin, were only discovered through testing. However, he makes no comment as to whether these properties were unexpected, superior or of special advantage in comparison to the benefits already disclosed by the parent compound of ofloxacin. In fact, he repeats over and again the view that the exact nature of the properties of the S(-) enantiomer would not have been known without experimentation. The affidavit of Dr. Wendy Arnott, a Janssen-Ortho Vice-President, addresses toxicity, but only with respect to Novopharm's allegation that the toxicity data set out in the '080 patent are misleading and false.", "064": "[64]\nThe Repta article and U.S. patents support Dr. Caldwell's position that there were various known techniques for isolating enantiomers of racemic compounds in the early 1980s. Dr. Klibanov, on cross-examination, admitted that the optical purity that he believed the '080 patent was addressing was at least 90%, and he recognized that 100% optical purity of an enantiomer is virtually impossible to achieve and is more a theoretical concept.", "107": "[107]\nDr. Caldwell's glove analogy only goes so far in dealing with compounds that require a particular isolation process that will allow a chemist to note the properties of each enantiomer. A pair of gloves is visible without requiring a process to produce such visibility.

In particular, Janssen refers to the two 1982 Gerster references which one of its affiants, Dr. Hans Schroeder, could not locate in any Canadian library, despite about two days of searching.

Novopharm describes the tests done to determine the relative pharmacological characteristics of known enantiomers of racemic compounds as in the nature of \"mere verification\" of inherent, already known attributes of the compound, rather than in the nature of \"searching for something novel\".

A person skilled in the art, reading the claims in the '080 patent, would understand that the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin in an optically pure form is described, as it is only when a substantial optical purity is present that the S(-) enantiomer becomes distinguishable from the racemate and the R(+) optical isomer. Janssen has satisfied me, on a balance of probabilities, that Novopharm's allegation of invalidity on the basis of ambiguity, because the patent lacks a definition or specification of optical purity, is not justified.\nSpecification insufficient", "099": "[99]\nNovopharm submits that prior disclosure of a pair of gloves inherently discloses its constituent left and right-hand gloves, and claiming a valid patent simply by asserting the term \"left glove\" cannot be viewed as asserting a novel patent claim that was not anticipated by an earlier disclosure of the \"pair of gloves\". In determining whether the '080 patent claims are novel, Novopharm also argues that Janssen's expert has improperly \"read in\" to the claims a purity level or limitation from the disclosure of the patent. Novopharm submits that such reading in from the disclosure should not be permitted to expand the scope of the patent claims and make them novel.", "022": "[22]\nAt the heart of the dispute between the parties as to the construction of the '080 patent is whether it claims the levorotatory optical isomer, as found or already disclosed within racemic ofloxacin (Novopharm's position) or claims such enantiomer as a separate, inventive compound (Janssen's position). Related to that question is the issue of whether \"S(-)\" as used to describe the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin can be construed to mean the S(-) isomer in a substantially pure form.", "112": "[112]\nThe applicants also refer to patents granted to Novopharm's parent company, for isomers that did not include any purity limitations.", "029": "[29]\nHaving reviewed the claims with the aid of the expert evidence in this proceeding, I am satisfied that the patent disclosure must form part of the construction to give the Court an understanding of the meaning behind the chemical formulae in the claims.

This demonstrates, in my view, that discovery of the beneficial properties in the S(-) optical isomer was the object and usefulness of this patent.", "069": "[69]\nVerification of certain attributes of an already disclosed compound does not meet the threshold of inventiveness required for patent protection. In\nSmithKline Beecham\n, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal found that only \"mechanical skill\", rather than inventive genius, was needed to apply the prior art to arrive at the invention contained in the challenged patent. As stated by the Court at page 138-39, \"The only 'improvement' referenced in the disclosure merely verifies properties of a known substance formulated using common techniques.\" In my opinion, the present case is similar, given that the inventors of the '080 patent were merely verifying properties of the known racemic ofloxacin by determining which of its enantiomers displayed better results with respect to antimicrobial activity, solubility and toxicity.", "071": "[71]\nI prefer Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the purportedly superior qualities of the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin with respect to antimicrobial activity set out in the '080 patent are not actually different, or of a special and unexpected nature, from the properties set out in the prior art, including in the '840 patent detailing the nature of ofloxacin. From Repta et al., the above-mentioned U.S. patents, and the two Gerster references, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it would have been obvious to the skilled chemist that one of the enantiomers of racemic ofloxacin could exhibit higher beneficial properties and that all that would be needed to confirm this was to conduct routine, simple testing. Determining and noting which enantiomer possessed higher antimicrobial activity, a quality already existing in the racemate, did not require inventive ingenuity.", "095": "[95]\nThese three references are the prior art cited by the respondent in its NOA with respect to anticipation or novelty.", "057": "[57]\nDr. Caldwell, at paragraphs 72-73 of his affidavit, refers to U.S. Patent 4,314,081, which states that with respect to the racemic compound in question, it \"can be resolved into its individual d and l isomers by methods well known in the art, particularly, by forming salts with optically active acids and separating the salts by crystallization.\" This '081 patent was not one of the references cited by the respondent in its NOA and in keeping with the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in\nAB Hassle et al. v.

It reads:\n'When the two enantiomers are of a chiral drug are sufficiently different in pharmacological effects from each other and from the racemate, it might be possible to obtain a patent for one or both enantiomers in addition to a valid (or expired) patent of the corresponding racemate.'\nA. Yes\nQ. In principle, I assume you agree with that.\nA. Yes. I mean when they are sufficiently different from each other and from the racemate. The whole phrase hinges around what we mean by sufficiently different.\"", "023": "[23]\nAs held by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nWhirlpool et al. v. Camco Inc. et al.\n, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067; 263 N.R. 88, and\nFree World Trust v. Electro Sant\u00e9 Inc. et al.\n, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024; 263 N.R. 150, a patent claim is to be construed in a \"purposive\" way, which involves a realistic construction of the language of the claims through the eyes, and with the learning, of a person skilled in the art (para. 44\nWhirlpool\n, supra). Moreover, the Court may look at the entire specification of the patent in order to understand the words as stated in any disputed claim, provided this does not enlarge or contract the scope of the actual patent claims.", "124": "[124]\nThe applicant argues that it is clear that Novopharm's product, described in the NOA as levofloxacin hemihydrate made using \"the free acid form\" of the compound rather than a salt of the compound, will infringe claims 2 and 17 of the '080 patent. These, it asserts, are interdependent and both include the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin. The formula in claim 2, together with a 1/2 mole of water constitutes levofloxacin hemihydrate. Claim 17 relies on claim 2 where the compound is a hydrate.", "014": "[14]\nJanssen-Ortho accepts that with respect to infringement, the legal burden is clearly its own. However, with respect to validity, the applicant submits that the burden of proof in a NOC proceeding shifts to the respondent due to the presumption that the patent is valid pursuant to section 45 of the pre-1989\nPatent Act\n. The parties agree that as the application for the '080 patent was made in 1986, the\nPatent Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 applies.", "102": "[102]\nDr. Klibanov attested that the teachings of the '840 patent and the '892 patent can only result in racemic ofloxacin. At paragraphs 67 and 68 of his affidavit he continues:\n\"There are special techniques that must be used to make an optical isomer, and these techniques are usually compound-specific. In the early 1980s, making an optical isomer with high optical purity was extremely difficult. While there were various techniques known at that time, their successful application to a specific compound, especially that as complex [as] ofloxacin, was impossible to predict.\n\"Moreover, in many situations a specific methodology was required to be developed to obtain an optical isomer. Indeed, much of the '080 Patent is dedicated to describing processes used to obtain the novel ofloxacin optical isomers. For these reasons, I can unequivocally state that a person skilled in the art following the teachings of the '840 and '8[9]2 Patents would never obtain the optical isomers of ofloxacin because the processes set out in these patents result only in racemic ofloxacin.\"\nHe maintained this position on cross-examination. Dr. Klibanov also attested that any particular properties of either optical isomer of ofloxacin over and above the other isomer or the racemate were not disclosed in any piece of prior art referenced by Novopharm.", "083": "[83]\nWhile not prior art, a section of the English text by Philip W. Grubb,\nPatents in Chemistry and Biotechnology\n(Clarendon Press: Oxford, U.K.), published in 1986, illustrates the common knowledge at that time among chemists respecting the nature of optical isomers claimed as new compounds in patents. As stated at page 134:\n\"Perhaps the closest that a new compound can be to the prior art is the situation when the new compound is an optically active enantiomer of a compound previously known only in racemic form.\nThis may be regarded as an extreme form of a selection invention\n, and it has been argued that the optically active form cannot be regarded as novel if the racemate is known, since the racemate could be considered as an equimolar mixture of the d- and l- forms. However, in cases both in the UK and the USA it has been decided that optical isomers of known racemates may be considered as novel per se.\n\"\nUsually\n, however,\nthe problem is regarded as one of obviousness rather than lack of novelty. It is obvious from the presence of an asymmetric centre in the molecule that optically active forms can exist, and it is usually obvious that they can be isolated by one or other of the standard methods of resolution. The only way in which an optical isomer can be patentable is if it has surprisingly superior properties as compared with the racemate, or if it has a use that the racemate did not have\n.\" (Emphasis added)", "044": "[44]\nThe applicant refers to an article written by Novopharm's expert, Dr. Caldwell, entitled \"Putting Chirality to Work: The Strategy of Chiral Switches\", wherein he recognized that in pairs of enantiomers in racemic mixtures it is uncertain which enantiomer is the \"antagonist\" or \"active\" one. Janssen stresses, relying on\nBayer Aktiengesellschaft\n, supra, that the test for obviousness does not involve testing or experimentation, but rather the mythical, skilled technician is expected to \"instantly and spontaneously\" know the answer which the patent teaches from the state of knowledge in the art at the date of invention.", "005": "[5]\nTo understand the invention claimed in the patent at issue, certain chemistry terms and relationships must be understood. I have had the benefit of counsel's assistance and the expert affidavits filed by both sides. Janssen-Ortho's primary expert, Dr. Klibanov, is a Professor of Chemistry and Bioengineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Novopharm's expert, Dr. Caldwell, is the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Liverpool. Both experts have extensive credentials and background in pharmacology and organic chemistry. For convenience, definitions of the terms employed in these reasons, based on my understanding of the evidence, are set out in Annex \"A\" .", "126": "[126]\nNovopharm submits that its levofloxacin hemihydrate product will not infringe claim 17 because it will be made using the free acid form of the compound and not a salt of the compound. No salt is present in the Novopharm formulation. Novopharm stresses that claim 17 must be read with claim 18, in that claim 17 requires, due to the word \"and\", the presence of \"pharmaceutical salts\" of the compound defined in claim 2, wherein that compound is a hydrate. Counsel stressed that the language in claim 18 where \"or\" is used, must be evaluated and contrasted with claim 17, indicating that the preparation claimed in 17 is the compound described in claim 2 only when it is in a pharmaceutically acceptable\nsalt\nform.", "076": "[76]\nOn cross-examination, it was apparent that Dr. Schroeder's search was not as thorough as one would reasonably have expected. He did not keep copies of his search results, or the search terms that he used with the various on-line databases. Moreover, he did not have much first-hand knowledge about certain searches for the Gerster references performed by a librarian who was under his supervision. Accordingly, I find that Dr. Schroeder's search was not as \"reasonable and diligent\" as one would expect of a skilled workman:\nGeneral Tire and Rubber Co. v. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co.\n, [1972] R.P.C. 457 (C.A.);\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. et al. v. Cobra Fixations Cie\n, supra.", "026": "[26]\nJanssen argues that a purposive construction of the relevant claims, including a reading of the specifications, discloses that the invention here is the recognition of the unexpected and beneficial properties that are present in the S(-) enantiomer and where the claim can be properly read as covering that enantiomer, the court should support its validity.", "093": "[93]\nIn asserting that a patent claim has been anticipated, the argument is that the invention has already been disclosed to the public and is therefore not novel. The well-established approach to anticipation is found in\nBeloit\n, supra, at page 297 [C.P.R.]:\n\"It will be recalled that\nanticipation, or lack of novelty, asserts that the invention has been made known to the public prior to the relevant time\n. The inquiry is directed to the very invention in suit and not, as in the case of obviousness, to the state of the art and to common general knowledge. Also ... anticipation must be found in a specific patent or other published document; it is\nnot enough to pick bits and pieces from a variety of prior publications and to meld them together so as to come up with the claimed invention. One must, in effect, be able to look at a prior, single publication and find in it all the information which, for practical purposes, is needed to produce the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive skill\n. The prior publication must contain\nso clear a direction\nthat a skilled person\nreading and following it would in every case and without possibility of error be led to the claimed invention\n. Where, as here, the invention consists of a combination of several known elements, any publication which does not teach the combination of all the elements claimed cannot possibly be anticipatory.\" (Emphasis added)", "089": "[89]\nJanssen argues that the prior art cited by Novopharm in its NOA with respect to lack of novelty, does not anticipate the discovered advantages of the particular optical isomer disclosed in the '080 patent. Counsel refers to\nMay, Re\n(1978), 197 U.S.P.Q. 601 (C.C.P.A.), a U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals decision in which a patent claim to a (-) compound was found not lacking in novelty even though the prior art disclosed its racemate.", "094": "[94]\nThis approach was more recently cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nFree World Trust\n, supra, at paragraph 26. Moreover, Justice Binnie in that decision cautioned against the use of ex post facto deduction in evaluating whether an invention was anticipated by a particular publication, since assembling a dossier of prior art with the benefit of hindsight is \"all too easy after an invention has been disclosed\" (\nFree World Trust\nat para. 25).\nThe '840 patent, its US equivalent - the '892 patent - and the 1983 Osada et al. publication", "055": "[55]\nAs noted above, the respondent relied upon several U.S. patents filed well prior to 1985 among the 26 references cited as prior art.", "021": "[21]\nThe applicant's reliance on the Supreme Court's reasoning in the\nSchmeiser\nand\nWellcome\ndecisions, with regard to the burden of proof, is not helpful in my view, as both were patent actions for declarations of invalidity and infringement. I do not agree that such reasoning is directly applicable in a NOC proceeding, which has been held to be akin to a summary proceeding by way of an application, involving its own unique set of principles and regulations, and where any finding regarding infringement or validity is not determinative of that matter in any subsequent patent action. As held in\nMerck Frosst\n, supra, at 319 [C.P.R.], a NOC proceeding is not an action and its object is \"solely to prohibit the issuance of a notice of compliance under the\nFood and Drug Regulations\n.\"\nConstruction of the '080 patent", "075": "[75]\nDr. Caldwell, on the other hand, describes flumequine as a \"structurally similar\" antimicrobial compound to racemic ofloxacin. He claims that Dr. Klibanov has \"inverted\" the diagram of flumequine contained in his affidavit. The Gerster abstract reference revealed that in isolating both optical isomers of flumequine, the (-) isomer had \"potent antibacterial activity\" and the (+) isomer only \"very weak activity\". The Gerster poster presentation disclosed both a method for separating the enantiomers of racemic flumequine and that the differential antimicrobial activity of the (-) enantiomer was about two times greater than that of racemic flumequine and between 10 to 100 times greater than the (+) enantiomer. Dr. Caldwell goes into some detail as to why these results would be applicable to ofloxacin.", "032": "[32]\nThe existence of such enantiomers of racemic ofloxacin seems undoubtedly accepted prior to 1984 and it was the development of a process for producing the S(-) enantiomer and the discovery of the beneficial properties of this enantiomer over racemic ofloxacin or the R isomer that are claimed in the '080 patent. Whether the invention claimed was obvious or anticipated, or was improperly set out in the patent claims and is vulnerable on other grounds of invalidity, are the issues dealt with in my analysis below.\nInvalidity", "115": "[115]\nNext, Novopharm alleges that the specification of the '080 patent is insufficient, as it fails to correctly and fully describe the invention as required by paragraph 34(1)(a) of the\nPatent Act\n, by citing inconsistent toxicity data. In the NOA, Novopharm alleged that if such omission was willfully made for the purposes of misleading the public, then the patent is void pursuant to subsection 53(1) of the\nPatent Act\n.", "105": "[105]\nDr. Caldwell maintains that Dr. Klibanov's statement that it would be very difficult to design a process of isolating enantiomers is not directed at the mere separation of racemic ofloxacin into its optical isomers but instead is directed to the development of processes to produce the enantiomer of interest\non a commercially economical basis\n, after a compound has been isolated and tested to confirm its pharmacological activity. Dr. Caldwell then asserts that the three processes set out in the disclosure of the '080 patent are \"production processes\" rather than merely resolution processes.", "038": "[38]\nThe critical date for assessing obviousness is the claimed date of the invention. The '080 patent claims priority from three Japanese patent applications. The respondent submits that the applicant has not led evidence to establish the date of invention; therefore, the relevant date for evaluating obviousness must be taken as being no earlier than the earliest possible priority date, one year prior to the Canadian patent application, June 20, 1985. The applicant conceded this at the hearing and I accept that this is the correct date in light of sections 28 and 29 of the\nPatent Act\nas it read prior to October 1, 1989.", "054": "[54]\nWith regard to Janssen's contention that if experimentation or testing is required in order to determine the invention, the resulting invention cannot be said to be obvious, I am persuaded by Novopharm's submission that the test for obviousness does not exclude routine testing to determine characteristics of known compounds, not undertaken for the purpose of \"searching for something novel\", but rather for the purpose of verifying the actual attributes of already known compounds, where the results indicate no new uses or surprising results, or properties that are clearly superior to the already known parent compound. Concerning the issue of determining whether there has been an inventive step or \"undue experimentation\" in the obviousness inquiry, see the reasoning of Justice Dawson of this Court in\nPfizer Canada Inc. et al. v. Apotex Inc. et al.\n(2002), 225 F.T.R. 1; 22 C.P.R.(4th) 466 (T.D.), at paras. 103-114.", "129": "[129]\nIn my view, therefore, Novopharm's levofloxacin hemihydrate product would infringe claims 2 and 17 of the '080 patent if it were valid.\nCosts", "080": "[80]\nWith regard to the toxicity findings, Dr. Caldwell attests that the comparative toxicity findings set out in the '080 patent are not at all significant for pharmaceutical formulation purposes, since therapeutic agents use concentrations of the drug substance at levels substantially below their \"acute toxicity levels\". This statement was not damaged on cross-examination. Further, Dr. Caldwell noted that based on the prior art it would be expected that a single enantiomer of an optically active compound would exhibit lower toxicity than its racemate.", "084": "[84]\nAs mentioned, I accept Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the properties described in the '080 patent concerning the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin were not unexpected or surprisingly superior to what had already been disclosed with respect to ofloxacin. Based on the prior art of Repta et al., the Gerster references, the '840 patent disclosing ofloxacin as racemic with particular beneficial properties, and the U.S. patents cited dealing with other racemic compounds similar in structure to ofloxacin [see footnote 3], such \"discovery\" would have been obvious to the ordinary skilled chemist, knowing the state of the art of stereoisomers in 1985.", "017": "[17]\nThe respondent Novopharm refers to the 2000 Federal Court of Appeal decision in\nBayer\n, supra, where Sharlow, J.A., commented on the statutory presumption of validity and how this affected the burden of proof in a NOC proceeding. Novopharm submits that the presumption of validity is spent when the respondent puts forward evidence to the contrary and if, in the end, the evidence on both sides is a \"draw\", then the applicant cannot be granted a prohibition order, as the overall legal burden, on a balance of probabilities, was its to carry. At paragraph 6 of\nBayer\n, Sharlow, J.A., stated as follows:\n\"In seeking to discharge its burden of proving the allegation to be unjustified, Bayer relied on the statutory presumption of the validity of its patent. Because that presumption exists, it may be said that Apotex, as the party responding to the application for a prohibition order, has a burden of proof in this sense:\nif Apotex had adduced\nno evidence that was capable of establishing\nthe invalidity of the patent, Bayer could have succeeded on the basis of the statutory presumption alone\n. As the Motions Judge correctly said at paragraph 15:\n'A statutory presumption, for example, may assist Bayer and \"have the effect of displacing the burden of proof\".'\" (emphasis added)", "015": "[15]\nThe applicant relies on\nMerck Frosst\n, supra, in support of this contention, referring to the following words of Hugessen, J.A., at page 319 [C.P.R.]:\n\"As I understand the scheme of the regulations, it is the party moving under s. 6, in this case Merck, which, as the initiator of the proceedings, has the carriage of the litigation and bears the initial burden of proof. That burden, as it seems to me, is a difficult one since it must be to disprove some or all of the allegations in the notice of allegation which, if left unchallenged, would allow the Minister to issue a notice of compliance. There may, of course, be some presumptions (such as for example the statutory presumption of validity of a patent) (\nPatent Act\n, s. 43) which may help the moving party and have the effect of displacing the burden of proof ...\"", "010": "[10]\nAnother term for describing optical isomers is \"enantiomer\" . An enantiomer is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror images; by analogy, one's hands. Compounds that exhibit this quality are called \"chiral\". They possess a chiral centre and in carbon compounds, such as ofloxacin, the chiral centre is a carbon atom that is bound to four different atoms or groups of atoms, where all four groups are different. Chirality confers a specific three-dimensional shape on a molecule.", "063": "[63]\nDr. Klibanov's interpretation of the Repta article was that while it may have been known that there could be some solubility benefits with certain isomers, there was no general predictability with respect to the solubility of the racemate as compared to that of each of the optical isomers of ofloxacin. This could have only been obtained through experimentation.", "079": "[79]\nDr. Caldwell also refers to the simplicity of the experiment to test for the solubility characteristics of a racemate. Again, Dr. Klibanov has not addressed the issue of whether the testing to confirm the properties of each enantiomer was routine, but rather focussed on the fact that in order to know with certainty the exact comparative nature of the enantiomers with the racemate, experimentation was required.", "109": "[109]\nNovopharm further alleges that the claims in the patent are both ambiguous and broader than the invention since they fail to include any \"purity limitation\" covering compositions which include the S(-) enantiomer mixed with other components, including the R(+) enantiomer. Novopharm therefore argues that the claims in the '080 patent are broader than the invention disclosed in the patent, since the '080 claims can cover any compound containing levofloxacin molecules, including the prior art of racemic ofloxacin (set out in the prior '840 patent), being an equal mixture of S(-) ofloxacin and R(+) ofloxacin, and the claims are invalid on this ground.", "122": "[122]\nDespite the fact that my determination on obviousness is sufficient to dismiss this application for a prohibition order, I will briefly address the issue of infringement. Both parties agree that the only claims at issue in relation to infringement are claims 2, 4, 7-9 and 17-19. As noted above, the process claims (1, 3, 5, 10 and 11) are not in issue. Claim 6 is also not in issue as it appears to claim a compound that is not levofloxacin due to the fact that \"ethyl\" is included in the formula rather than \"methyl\". Claims 12-16 are not at issue as the applicant conceded that they clearly relate to salts of levofloxacin.", "065": "[65]\nDr. Caldwell determined that the testing employed in the '080 patent for solubility, antimicrobial activity and toxicity levels of the enantiomers was done using simple, analytical procedures that did not involve any inventiveness. Dr. Klibanov did not address whether the experiments that were performed to determine the properties of the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin were relatively simple ones. He only addressed the issue, as I read his affidavit and cross-examination, of the isolation of the distinct S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin, finding that this was difficult to do and not disclosed by any previous ofloxacin patent.", "008": "[8]\nLevofloxacin, the subject of the '080 patent and these proceedings, and ofloxacin, disclosed in the expired '840 patent, can both be described as broad-spectrum, synthetic antibacterial agents useful in the treatment of infections caused by certain strains of microorganisms, such as certain types of pneumonia, influenza, skin infections and urinary tract infections. Ofloxacin and levofloxacin formulas have also been marketed for eye infections under different brand names.", "061": "[61]\nThe 1976 article entitled\nUtilization of an Enantiomer as a Solution to a Pharmaceutical Problem: Application to Solubilization of 1,2-Di(4-piperazine-2,6-dione) propane\nby Repta et al., supra, cited by the respondent as prior art, refers to the ease in creating optical isomers, but notes (at p. 241) the difficulty in resolving them for an optical purity of close to 100%:\n\"An inherent drawback in the use of an enantiomer is the greater difficulty and expense of preparation relative to the racemic material.\nGenerally, it is not particularly difficult to attain an optical purity greater than 90%\n. [emphasis added] However, the preparation of essentially 100% optically pure material is extremely difficult and expensive. Therefore, it must be realized that it is not necessary to strive for 100% optically pure samples to obtain greatly increased solubility.\"\nThe Repta article describes (p. 239) the generally known feature that typically one enantiomer exhibits greater or different biological activity than the racemate:\n\"Although the employment of optically active compounds in pharmaceutical formulations is not new, their past and present usage has been due largely to one enantiomer exhibiting a quantitatively or qualitatively different biological activity than the corresponding racemic compound (6,7) Examples of such drugs include ... [four examples mentioned, not ofloxacin]\"", "104": "[104]\nDr. Klibanov maintains that the process for the isolation or resolution of the ofloxacin enantiomers would not inevitably be apparent from the '840 patent, and would in fact be difficult to determine. Further, the beneficial properties of the S(-) optical isomer of ofloxacin would not be known from any of the pieces of prior art cited by Novopharm as anticipatory.", "035": "[35]\nThe commonly accepted test for obviousness was set out in\nBeloit Canada Ltd. v.

It is a very difficult test to satisfy\n.\" (Emphasis added)", "047": "[47]\nThe '080 patent can be described as a \"selection patent\" in that levofloxacin was selected out of its class of substances - the racemate and the two enantiomers - because of its beneficial properties.

(Toronto: Carswell Company Ltd., 1969), pp. 89-90, describes inventiveness in the context of selection patents:\n\"Invention may be exercised by selecting one out of a number of substances for a particular purpose even though others of that class have been used before for the same purpose,\nprovided there is a special advantage\nto be derived from the use of the selected substance and its selection constitutes a\ndefinite advance\nupon existing knowledge.

Therefore, I am satisfied that Janssen has demonstrated that Novopharm's allegation of invalidity on this ground is not justified.\nInfringement", "101": "[101]\nIs there one piece of prior art which teaches the \"discovery\" claimed in the '080 patent?

Also in\nMylan\n, supra, the court found that the specification's repeated use of the words \"optically active\" and the contrast made between racemic ofloxacin and levofloxacin in the patent disclosure indicated that the patent dealt with the levorotatory enantiomer of ofloxacin.

Therefore, in undertaking experimentation to verify which enantiomer possessed comparatively better qualities in these areas, no inventive step was involved.", "066": "[66]\nDr. Caldwell attests that the results of the testing on the optical isomers of racemic ofloxacin were not unexpected or surprising, given that the state of the scientific knowledge at the time was such that it was known that racemic compounds with certain attributes usually result from one of the enantiomers having quantitatively or qualitatively different biological activity from the racemic compound or the other enantiomer.

The applicant submits that it was only after the S(-) optical isomer was \"made\" and then experimentation performed, that the invention, that is levofloxacin as a separate compound having certain benefits, was discovered. This discovery has enough inventive ingenuity to demonstrate that the patent claims are not obvious.", "087": "[87]\nI find that the '080 patent is invalid for obviousness.

The S(-) designation indicates, instead, to an ordinary person skilled in the art that \"practically all\" of the molecules in the compound are of this configuration and \"substantially free\" of the molecules that have a \"R\" configuration. A chemist would also know that the solid wedge symbol indicates that \"practically all\" of the molecules have a \"S\" configuration.

The beneficial properties discovered and set out in the '080 patent were not unknown. They were the same beneficial properties found in ofloxacin, only to a greater degree of effectiveness. Further, I find that knowledge of the existence of and the possibility of separating the two enantiomers of ofloxacin was common to the ordinary chemist, and the determination of which enantiomer possessed a greater amount of the same benefits of the previously known racemic antibiotic was not surprising or inventive. This determination was made from one of three possibilities, not a great number of possibilities; that is, either the S(-) enantiomer, R (+) enantiomer or the racemate would exhibit better qualities, in comparison to each other, relating to the properties of antimicrobial activity, toxicity or solubility.", "085": "[85]\nI am satisfied that Novopharm has established on a balance of probabilities that a technician skilled in the art would have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the '080 patent by simply conducting known, routine experiments with racemic ofloxacin. I conclude that the claims set out in the '080 patent are obvious; what is claimed as the \"discovery\" or \"invention\" in the '080 patent does not suggest the scintilla of inventive ingenuity to qualify for the patent monopoly, but rather was the result of \"mere verification\" of the attributes of already known components of a compound.", "127": "[127]\nNovopharm argues that Janssen's contention that claims 2, 4, 6, 8 , 9 and 18 comprise all forms, including various hydrates, solvates or polymorphic forms of levofloxacin, cannot stand. In view of Janssen's expert's opinion that approximately 90 per cent of the molecules are S(-) optical isomers of ofloxacin, the patent claims cannot reach as far as covering the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin, since for the hemihydrate form to exist, the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin would be linked with 1/2 mole of water, meaning that 1/3 of the molecules in the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin would not meet the definition of the S(-) enantiomer claimed in the patent.", "049": "[49]\nNovopharm submits that the '080 patent does not meet the requirements for a selection patent. Adopting Professor Fox's words, it argues that mere verification is not invention and that a selection patent must not reproduce the same process with a statement of the properties possessed by the selected bodies. Unlike the patent at issue in the case of\nDuPont Nemours (E.I.) & Co. Application, Re\n, [1982] F.S.R. 303 (H.L.), the respondent asserts that the '080 patent does not make a discovery of a selected entity that has different valuable properties in a different field.", "106": "[106]\nIn my view, Dr. Klibanov's statement is not so qualified. I do not read his words as indicating that the difficulty in \"making\" the optical isomer with high optical purity is restricted to the production of a particular enantiomer on a commercial scale.", "011": "[11]\nWhen produced, levofloxacin was discovered to possess beneficial properties over both racemic ofloxacin and the R(+) optical isomer. The specification of the '080 patent, under the heading \"Background of the Invention\" at pages 1-2, discloses the beneficial properties of the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin (levofloxacin) in contrast to the racemic ofloxacin and the R(+) compound, as follows:\n\"... The present inventors obtained optically active compounds of the racemic Ofloxacin and found that the S(-)-compound possesses an antimicrobial activity of about 2 times higher than that of the (\u00b1)-compound and acute toxicity LD50 weaker than that of the (\u00b1)-compound as determined in mice by intravenous administration. On the other hand, the present inventors found that the R(+)-compound exhibits an antimicrobial activity of only about 1/10 to 1/100 times that of the (\u00b1)-compound, whereas it possess an acute toxicity substantially equal to that of the (\u00b1)-compound. That is, the S(-)-form of Ofloxacin has been found to have very desirable properties, i.e., increased antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity, and is expected to be a very useful pharmaceutical agents [sic] as compared with the (\u00b1)-compound. Further, both the R(+)- and S(-)-compounds of Ofloxacin in the free form have markedly high water-solubility as compared with the (\u00b1)-compound and as compared with free compounds of this type, and can be used as injectable preparations. These advantages will be apparent from the experimental data shown hereinafter.\"\nISSUES", "034": "[34]\nTurning first to obviousness, the Federal Court of Appeal in\nDiversified Products Corp. and Brown Fitzpatrick Lloyd Patent Ltd. v.

These references, cited by Novopharm as prior art in its NOA, dealt with the likelihood of better properties in racemic flumequine existing on the (-) enantiomer. The claimed inability of Schroeder to find these prior art references is relevant to whether a person skilled in the art could have predicted that it would be the (-) enantiomer of ofloxacin that would be responsible for the antimicrobial activity of the racemate.", "116": "[116]\nJanssen submits that there is no evidence to suggest that the toxicity data reported in the '080 patent is incorrect. Janssen brought forward the affidavit of evidence of Dr. Wendy Arnott on this issue. Novopharm did not file any evidence in response.", "062": "[62]\nI recognize that while Repta et al. noted that the optically active compounds had been known to have one enantiomer exhibiting a different biological activity than the racemate, the results that were actually found in this study were, at page 241 of the article, that the \"antitumor activity for each enantiomer was equivalent to that of the (\u00b1)-I. Therefore any pharmaceutical advantage to be realized from the use of an enantiomer could only arise from its significantly greater solubility relative to (\u00b1)-I.\" The Repta article then described the findings of the increased solubility of the individual enantiomers relative to the racemate.", "009": "[9]\nOfloxacin is a racemic compound, that is a substance containing equal amounts of two optical isomers. An isomer is one of a number of molecules that have the same constituent atoms; however, the bonds between the atoms are oriented differently in space. Their optical quality refers to their ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, that is, light focussed to shine only in one direction. Optical isomers that rotate polarized light to the right, in a clockwise direction, are \"dextrorotatory\" and use the symbols (+) or (d) for \"dextro\". Optical isomers that rotate polarized right to the left, in a counter-clockwise direction, are \"levorotatory\" and use the symbols (-) or (l) for \"levo\".

He stated that the optical isomer disclosed in that application is a compound that is very different from ofloxacin and that this reference does not indicate any advantages of one optical isomer over the other isomer or the racemate.", "028": "[28]\nIn my view, the claims of the '080 patent would be read by a person skilled in the art as referring to the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin and not to racemic ofloxacin. In claims 1, 2 and 10 of the '080 patent the phrase \"S(-) ... compound\" is employed, as are solid-coloured wedges in the graphical depictions of the formulas for the compounds in the claims. The use of the \"S\" and \"(-)\" symbols and the solid-coloured wedges designates, from what the expert affidavit evidence has revealed in this proceeding, an optically active isomer with an \"S\" configuration rotating the plane of polarized light in a counter-clockwise direction. Racemic ofloxacin would not be described using the S(-) prefix. Moreover, the specification of the '080 patent confirms this construction of the claims. The disclosure refers to \"optically active compounds of Ofloxacin\" or the \"racemic Ofloxacin\" in contrast to the description of the S(-) enantiomer.", "097": "[97]\nJanssen's expert, Dr. Klibanov, agrees that even though the '840 patent does not expressly indicate that ofloxacin is a chiral compound, \"this would be apparent to an ordinary chemist based on the chemical structure of ofloxacin\" (para. 64 of his affidavit). Novopharm points to Klibanov's cross-examination where he acknowledges that a chemist having read through the '840 patent would understand that the structure therein shown was a racemate.", "100": "[100]\nThe applicant argues that the Osada et al. reference does not add anything new beyond the teachings of the prior '840 patent and it does not anticipate the '080 patent since following the teachings of this reference would not make levofloxacin in every event, without possibility of error.", "088": "[88]\nWhile my conclusion above concerning obviousness is enough to determine this application, I will address the remaining issues in this proceeding. Paragraphs 27(1)(b) and 61(1)(a) of the pre-1989\nPatent Act\nare applicable with respect to anticipation. The application for the '080 patent was filed on June 19, 1986, therefore any prior art referenced by Novopharm must be either a patent issued two years before this filing date, that is June 19, 1984, or a published paper or article made available to the public before June 19, 1984. Any document that was not published and available to the public before June 19, 1984 cannot be relied upon for anticipation.", "068": "[68]\nIn my opinion, this is in line with the approach in patent law that a patentable discovery must involve some inventive ingenuity. The improvements contemplated on the already discovered racemic compound must demonstrate \"sufficiently different\" characteristics from what was already known in order for the patent not to be declared invalid for obviousness. This is just a different way of articulating the \"special property\" concept described by Fox, above, that a selection patent must possess in order to qualify for a new patent on the selection and description of an item from an already known group or series.", "091": "[91]\nThe respondent submits that the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin was inherently disclosed in the ofloxacin '840 patent in May 1984 and that before 1984, the breakdown of enantiomers from a racemic compound was \"routine\" and did not involve the exercise of any inventiveness.", "030": "[30]\nWith respect to the question of whether \"S(-)\" - as used to describe the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin in the '080 patent - can be construed to mean S(-) in a substantially pure form, I accept that proposition. A chemist skilled in the art when reading \"S(-)-pyridobenzoxazine compound\" as described in a particular formula would, in my opinion, accept that such compound is principally made up of the S(-) enantiomer of a racemic compound, wherein the optical activity of the S(-) enantiomer is not only detectable, but dominant. The lack of numeric quantification of the purity level of the S(-) enantiomer is not fatal to distinguishing this compound from either the racemic compound or the R(+) enantiomer.", "060": "[60]\nI accept Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the techniques for isolating and verifying optical isomers were generally known and appear to have been understood and used by chemists in the early 1980s. The prior art Dr. Caldwell describes, including several patents published prior to the date of invention that detail the particular benefits of enantiomers isolated from other racemic antibiotics, also demonstrates that synthesizing individual enantiomers from racemic compounds was not the \"extremely difficult\" proposition maintained at one point by Dr. Klibanov. In fact, Dr. Klibanov recognized that, while making optical isomers with high optical purity was difficult, there were \"various techniques known at that [the early 1980s] time\" to undertake the process.", "131": "[131]\nThere will be no order as to costs either in favour of or against the Respondent, the Minister of Health.\nORDER", "125": "[125]\nDr. Klibanov's affidavit evidence is that claim 17 cannot be limited to hydrates of a salt of levofloxacin and that Novopharm's product, as a hemihydrate of levofloxacin, will literally be within the scope of claims 2 and 17, as well as claims 4, 7-9, 18 and 19. Since Novopharm admits it will make tablets that contain levofloxacin hemihydrate together with a carrier, its product will also infringe claim 18 of the patent.", "051": "[51]\nWhat Fox and the jurisprudence suggest, in my view, when dealing with selection patents, is that in order to demonstrate sufficient inventive ingenuity, there must be discovered some\nspecial\nadvantage or quality, previously unknown, or an advantage discovered for a new use, which constitutes a definite advance upon the knowledge already existing with regard to the original group or series.

Dr. Caldwell's position is that a chemist reading the '840 patent (and by implication, its U.S. counterpart, the '892 patent) would \"immediately understand\" that ofloxacin possesses a single chiral centre and based solely on its chemical structure, it would be apparent to a chemist that there must exist two enantiomers, or optical isomers. Dr. Caldwell also attests that the enantiomeric nature of ofloxacin was expressly disclosed in a publication by Osada et al. in 1983, \"Antimycoplasmal Activity of Ofloxacin\", where ofloxacin is identified using the (\u00b1) symbol. The use of this symbol indicates that the authors of this article recognized the existence of both the (+) and (-) enantiomers of ofloxacin.", "092": "[92]\nNovopharm refers to other patents for racemic mixtures similar in structure to ofloxacin that can exist in optically active forms.

The applicant also says that the language used by the Supreme Court in these decisions indicates that the determination of invalidity can only be made after the Court is satisfied that the Commissioner of Patents was \"clearly wrong\", or made an unreasonable decision in granting the patent in the first place. The applicant submits that the reasoning of the Supreme Court in these patent actions applies equally to NOC proceedings.", "128": "[128]\nIn my opinion, Novopharm's interpretation cannot be accepted. As Janssen has pointed out, Novopharm's expert Dr. Caldwell in fact acknowledged in cross-examination that levofloxacin hemihydrate is within claim 17. Novopharm has described its product in the NOA as levofloxacin hemihydrate. Further, Novopharm's interpretation ignores the final words of claim 17: \"wherein said compound is a hydrate.\" The proper construction of claim 17 covers levofloxacin, in any hydrate form, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, but is not necessarily limited to the salts. However, I do not accept Janssen's contention that \"S(-)\" - meaning principally S(-) or the S(-) optical isomer of ofloxacin in a substantially pure form - means water cannot exist in the compound form. The '080 patent expressly states that the compound when it is a hydrate is included within claim 17.", "117": "[117]\nNovopharm submits that the toxicity data set out for the racemic mixture in the '080 patent is inconsistent with the toxicity data previously reported by the inventors in the ofloxacin '840 patent, claiming the racemate.

Even a less demanding standard like that of reasonableness simpliciter does not imply intervention by the Court, since the officer's decision was reasonable and based on a defensible explanation (see\nDirector of Investigation and Research, Competition Act v.

The absence of any ETF for accountants may indicate that \"accountant\" is intended to be a generic description of the specific occupations listed in 1111 (C.A., C.G.A., C.M.A.), and that there is no occupation of accountant \"simpliciter\". Those whose work can be described as involving accounting, but who are not a C.A., C.G.A., or C.M.A., may ask to be assessed in the NOC categories of \"miscellaneous accountant\" or \"book keeper\", as indeed the applicant had been in his previous visa application.", "029": "[29]\nAs I have indicated above, one reading of the CAIPS notes is that the officer did consider this occupation, but because he concluded that the applicant did not meet the ETF for it, he proceeded no further. Nonetheless, it is certainly possible to infer from the visa officer's affidavit that he did not make an assessment in this occupation, since he stated that neither the applicant nor his counsel had requested that the application be assessed for the occupation of accountant, which he also said was not a related occupation to that of financial manager.", "023": "[23]\nOn this view of the NOC the visa officer was correct to conclude that the applicant did not satisfy the ETF for an accountant. This is because Mr. Madan lacked the accreditation required for the three occupations listed under the generic occupational category of accountant.

Given the ambiguities of the text, the technical and non-legal nature of the subject matter, and the fact that the applicant can always submit a fresh application, I cannot say that the visa officer's conclusion was so unreasonable that the decision to refuse a visa should be set aside as erroneous in law.\n2.

The applicant has one of the relevant ETF numerical indicators, namely 7+ (bachelor's degree, and extensive experience and demonstrated ability). Therefore, the visa officer erred in law in finding that Mr. Madan did not satisfy the ETF for an accountant and that he could not therefore consider Mr. Madan's employment experience.", "032": "[32]\nSecond, the applicant's representative had clearly indicated on the notation attached to the visa application form that the applicant was being put forward in the occupation of financial manager and not miscellaneous accountant, which had been the designated intended occupation in the applicant's previous unsuccessful application.", "017": "[17]\nOn the basis of these facts counsel made two submissions. First, if, as the CAIPS notes suggest, the visa officer considered the occupation of accountant and found that the applicant did not meet the Education and Training Factor, he erred in law in his interpretation of the relevant provisions of the NOC. Second, if, as the visa officer's affidavit suggests, he did not assess the application by considering the occupation of accountant because the applicant had not so requested, he erred in law because the occupation is inherent in Mr. Madan's employment experience.\n1. Accountants And ETF", "015": "[15]\nAs the notation by Sun indicates, Mr. Madan had made a previous unsuccessful application for a visa; it had been directed to the Canadian Embassy in Saudi Arabia.", "010": "[10]\nI infer from this that the visa officer had considered assessing Mr. Madan in the occupation of an accountant. This would not be surprising in view of the letters from employers that were submitted with the application.", "008": "[8]\nThe second ground of review on which counsel relied was that the visa officer had erred in law by failing to assess Mr. Madan in the occupation of accountant, an occupation that was inherent in his work experience. In order to appreciate this submission it is necessary to set out more of the factual background.", "013": "[13]\nIn this same affidavit the visa officer also said, after concluding that Mr. Madan's duties did not appear to be those of a financial manager,\n\"I compared that definition [of the duties of a financial manager] with the one of accountant (NOC 1111) and found that the experience of the applicant corresponds to the one of accountant. However, neither the applicant or his counsel required that the application be reviewed for the requirement of accountant. Nor is a financial manager a related occupation to an accountant.\"\nIn other words, the visa officer did not assess the applicant as an accountant because he had not been asked to do so and the occupation of accountant is not a related occupation to that of financial manager.", "006": "[6]\nIt is well established that it is the responsibility of a visa applicant to put before the officer all the material necessary for a favourable decision to be made. Hence, visa officers are under no general legal duty to ask for clarification or for additional information before rejecting a visa application on the ground that the material submitted was insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant had met the relevant selection criteria.", "020": "[20]\nTitle 1111.2, \"Accountants\", lists under the sub-heading \"Education/Training\", \"5+, 6+, 7+ R.\" These numerical indicators refer to: vocational or specific training programs (5); college or technical school diplomas (6); and undergraduate degrees (7). The \"+\" indicates that additional requirements must be met over and above education and training, which could include extensive experience and demonstrated ability. \"R\" means that some regulated requirements exist for that group.", "002": "[2]\nOn his application form Mr. Madan gave his intended occupation in Canada as financial manager. In July 1998 the visa officer refused to issue a visa to Mr. Madan because he had not been awarded the number of units of assessment normally required for a successful application in the independent category.", "011": "[11]\nThus, one letter of reference described him as \"chief accountant/assistant manager for one of our clients M.T.C. Ltd.\" A letter from M.T.C. Ltd. itself confirms that Mr. Madan's \"basic job\" was chief accountant, and praises his \"overall accuracy and efficiency in accounting\". A third letter, written in 1979 on behalf of a company in India with whom Mr. Madan was then employed, stated that he had been working as an accountant: \"he is responsible for finalisation of accounts up to preparation of annual balance sheet, profit & loss, bank reconciliation and subsidiary accounts.\"", "034": "[34]\nFor these reasons the application for judicial review is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.", "009": "[9]\nThe visa officer's CAIPS notes, presumably entered close to the time when he assessed Mr. Madan's application, state:\n\"Appears applicant does some accounting. However, he does not meet the ETF requirements as an accountant.\"", "012": "[12]\nI also infer from the CAIPS notes that the visa officer decided not to make a full and formal assessment of the application in the occupation of accountant because Mr. Madan did not possess the requisite level of education and training prescribed for this occupation in the NOC. This inference is supported by the statement in the visa officer's affidavit that he \"noted that Mr. Madan has no degree in accounting\".", "028": "[28]\nThis point only arises, of course, if the visa officer did not assess the applicant in the occupation of accountant, and \"accountant\" is a discrete occupation in the NOC. I shall assume for the purpose of this argument that a person may be considered in the generic occupational category of accountant.", "030": "[30]\nAs counsel conceded, there is authority in this court both for and against the proposition that visa officers are under a legal obligation to assess an application by considering an occupation which is inherent in the applicant's work experience and for which the applicant is qualified and experienced, even though that occupation is not designated in the \"intended occupation\" box on the application form, and is not one that the applicant at any time ever requested the officer to take into consideration.", "004": "[4]\nIn his written argument counsel made two submissions in support of the application for judicial review of the visa officer's decision. The first was that it was unreasonable for the visa officer to conclude that Mr. Madan's work experience did not match the duties of a financial manager. Furthermore, the refusal to issue the visa was procedurally unfair because the visa officer had not invited the applicant to elaborate and clarify the precise nature of his employment duties so as to enable him to make an accurate determination of whether they fell within the NOC's description of the duties of a financial manager.", "025": "[25]\nIn addition, while the NOC is incorporated by reference into the\nImmigration Regulations, 1978\n, SOR/78-172 by s. 8(1) and Schedule I, it was not drafted with a view to determining legal rights and duties, and is accordingly not written in the style of a legal instrument. Consequently, when subjected to the searchlight of legal analysis, its provisions will often be found to be ambiguous or vague, as is the case here.", "001": "[1]\nEvans, J.\n: Anil Kumar Madan, a citizen of India residing in Saudi Arabia, applied to the Canadian High Commission in Pakistan for admission to Canada as a permanent resident in the independent immigrant category.", "016": "[16]\nIt is clear from the letter of decision written by the visa officer in response to that application that Mr. Madan had applied in the intended occupation of \"miscellaneous accountant\". This occupation carries relatively few units of assessment for either occupational demand in Canada, or Special Vocational Preparation. The visa officer at that time also assessed Mr. Madan's application by considering the related occupation of \"book keeper\", in which the applicant was qualified and experienced. However, in neither occupation was the applicant awarded sufficient units of assessment to obtain a favourable decision, and his application was refused.", "003": "[3]\nIn particular, the visa officer awarded Mr. Madan no units of assessment for experience, because, on the basis of the materials submitted, he was not satisfied that the applicant was performing the duties of a financial manager as described in the\nNational Occupational Classification\n.", "007": "[7]\nAccordingly, the application for judicial review cannot succeed on the basis of this first submission."}, "decision": "A decision of a visa officer whether an applicant meets the NOC criteria is one of discretion, based on the visa officer's experience and familiarity with the NOC and immigration requirements generally"}, "510": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nAgain, paragraph 21(b) of the statement of claim, which sets out that the\nPneumocort\ntrademark is not distinctive, is, given the factual material which precedes it and the sections of the\nTrade-marks Act\nwhich follow it, sufficient from the point of view of explaining the nature of the case to be met, to inform the defendant that, from the plaintiffs' point of view, there has been and may in future be confusion between the trademarks and a resulting lack of distinctiveness.", "033": "[33]\nThe statement of claim, which contains a number of short and quite concise paragraphs, is a good deal more brief than many statements of claim in patent and trademark litigation. Brevity in a statement of claim, so long as it does not either leave the defendant guessing or make the hearing of the action difficult to regulate when the case is tried, is a virtue. Others might draft the statement of claim differently than has been done here. That is not a ground to say that this statement of claim does not limit and define the issues to be tried.", "037": "[37]\nThe defendant says that the plaintiffs have referred to the applicable sections of the\nTrade-marks Act\n, in paragraph 23, as including those sections which are specifically enumerated and as a result the pleading is ambiguous, open-ended, and leaves the possibility of raising other grounds of unregisterability or lack of entitlement.", "041": "[41]\nThe defendant has made the point, several places in the written argument, that it would be simple enough for the plaintiff to plead exactly what it is relying upon. The contrary view is that the motion should not have been brought in the first place, for the plaintiffs' case is abundantly clear.", "031": "[31]\nIn summary, the plaintiffs' statement of claim, taken as a whole, is specific and not general.\nTo Limit The Issues\nFor Discovery", "018": "[18]\nAs a result of all of this, the plaintiffs say that the defendant is using their\nPneumocort\ntrademark in such a way as to cause or to be likely to cause confusion with the plaintiffs'\nPulmicort\ntrademark and further that the defendant's activities are both an infringement of the plaintiffs' rights in the\nPulmicort\ntrademark and will likely have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attached to the plaintiffs'\nPulmicort\ntrademark.", "040": "[40]\nIn summary, the facts and conclusions of law, set out in paragraphs 5 through 22 of the statement of claim, adequately tie the hands of the plaintiffs. That the plaintiffs may appear to be trying to broaden the scope of their attack, by including unspecified sections of the\nTrade-marks Act\n, is an illusion: if the plaintiffs in fact wished to broaden the scope of the matter, beyond the facts they have pleaded, they would need leave to amend.\nConclusion", "042": "[42]\nThe defendant, who has not filed affidavit evidence as to the need for particulars for pleading, has not convinced me that, on the face of the statement of claim, it is deficient in particulars. Indeed, even if the application had been supported by affidavit evidence as to the necessity for particulars, I would have reached the same conclusion.", "024": "[24]\nThe defendant, in its submissions, relies on the functions of particulars as set out in the\nWhite Book\nand referred to in The\n\"Mary Mackin\"\n, supra. In that the present particulars are requested in the defendant's motion for the purpose of pleading to the statement of claim, the second and third functions of particulars set out in the\nWhite Book\n, to prevent surprise at trial and to enable the other side to know what evidence they ought to be prepared with and to prepare for trial, are not applicable in this instance as they relate to trial and not directly to pleading and, indeed, if discovery should take place, may not be needed as particulars per say. I therefore turn to the four remaining functions.\nNature Of Case To Be Met", "019": "[19]\nAt this point in the statement of claim, we reach paragraph 21, setting out that:\n\"21. Further still, in view of the aforesaid, the defendant's said registration of the PNEUMOCORT trademark is invalid and ought to be expunged as:\n(a) the PNEUMOCORT trademark was not registrable at the date of registration;\n(b) the PNEUMOCORT trademark was not distinctive at the date this proceeding was commenced; and\n(c) the defendant was not the person entitled to secure the PNEUMOCORT registration.\"\nThis is the paragraph about which the defendant submits needs particulars.", "022": "[22]\nParagraph 21(b) of the statement of claim, taken together with the background information set out in paragraphs 5 through 20, concludes that the defendant's\nPneumocort\ntrademark was not distinctive, given the confusion that it has caused or is likely to cause with the plaintiffs' trademark. The defendant, in a reply to the plaintiffs' submissions, raises an argument based on the\nTrade-marks Act\ndefinition of \"distinctive\" in s. 2, about adaption of the trademark to distinguish wares, as opposed to actually distinguishing wares: this is something best left to be explored on discovery, or argued at trial.", "029": "[29]\nIn summary, there are enough particulars contained in the statement of claim and attached Schedules to enable the defendant to know the nature of the case to be met. If the plaintiffs were required to give much further information, it would at least be a fishing expedition and might well touch on how the case is to be proven.\nLimiting The Generality\nOf Pleadings", "023": "[23]\nThe defendant, in its motion, sets out that the particulars are necessary for pleading. Particulars before a defence and for the purpose of pleading are not as broad as those furnished for the purposes of trial. A request for particulars is not a fishing expedition. The test is whether a defendant has enough information to be able to understand the plaintiffs' position and to prepare a responsive defence:\n\"A defendant should not be allowed to use a request for particulars as a means to pry into the brief of his opponent with a view to finding out about the scope of the evidence that might be produced against him at trial, nor should he be allowed to use such a request as a means to go on a sort of fishing expedition in order to discover some grounds of defence still unknown to him. At that early stage, a defendant is entitled to be furnished all particulars which will enable him to better understand the position of the plaintiff, see the basis of the case made against him and appreciate the facts on which it is founded so that he may reply intelligently to the statement of claim and state properly the grounds of defence on which he himself relies, but he is not entitled to go any further and require more than that.

This is not a point which impresses me, for given the background information set out in the statement of claim it is clear that the defendant's trademark is not registerable because it was confusing with a registered trademark, that of the plaintiffs, as provided for in s. 12(1)(d) of the\nTrade-marks Act\n:\n\"12.1\tSubject to s. 13, a trademark is registerable if it is not ...\n(d) confusing with a registered trademark; ... \"", "032": "[32]\nThe fifth test set out in the\nWhite Book\n, as a function of particulars, is \"to limit and define the issues to be tried, and as to which discovery is required\".", "038": "[38]\nThe word \"including\" generally, but does not always, enlarges the scope of enumerated items: see for example\nDilworth v.

Reduced to its essentials, the statement of claim sets out a prior registration of the plaintiffs' trademark, promotion, and use of the trademark in order to obtain sales equating to a very substantial market share, confusion over the defendant's use of a similar trademark, and an infringement which has damaged the goodwill attached to the plaintiffs'\nPulmicort\ntrademark, all of which lead to the three propositions of law set out in paragraph 21 of the statement of claim.", "009": "[9]\nMr. Justice Teitelbaum, in\nFlexi-Coil Ltd. v.

Leaving aside that here the defendant's complaint is one in connection with preparation for trial, as opposed to particulars for pleading, the plaintiffs have again led up to the distinctiveness point and conclusion of law by being very specific as to the use of the plaintiffs' trademark; the specific wares, drugs for the treatment of pulmonary disease marketed under the trademark; the method in which they are used; the similarity of the defendant's trademark, wares, and manner in which they are used; the importance of the trademark to the plaintiffs, including as to market share; and the confusion that has resulted or may result in future.

Cowessess Indian Band No. 73 et al.\n(1993), 63 F.T.R. 242 (T.D.), in which the actions of an election appeal board, under a\nReserve Election Act\n, were at issue.", "010": "[10]\nSection 1 of Part VIII of the\nCustoms Election Regulations\ndeals with election appeals.

On the one hand it is the plaintiffs' position that no appeal was ever filed, but on the other hand the defendants say that an appeal was taken to the desk at the Band Office and stamped.", "008": "[8]\nOn the plaintiffs' analysis, a failure to exhaust the election appeal remedies under the\nCustoms Election Regulations\n, and leaving aside whether or not a proper or any Election Appeal Board had been established, the plaintiffs must show that no appeal was filed. There is various affidavit material to this effect, including the affidavit of Joan Bent, the Electoral Officer for the election in question and the February 2, 1996, affidavit of Tony Qualtier which sets out that he was asked to sit on the Election Appeal Board, but did not see a copy of the appeal petition. However, there is conflicting evidence for the defendants. For example, the affidavit of Theresa Dennis, sworn July 18, 1994, sets out that:\n\"7. On April 27, 1994, an appeal of the Election (the 'Appeal') was filed in the LSIB [Lower Similkameen Indian Band] office. It was stamped by Kathy Terbasket. The Appeal was signed by 36 LSIB members.

Teleprompter Cable Communications Corp.\n, [1972] F.C. 1265 (F.C.A.), at pp. 1267-1268:\n\"Turning to the second branch of the case, a preliminary point should be mentioned as to whether the power of a superior court to grant declaratory relief is necessarily ousted where the statute governing the particular matter provides a special procedure in another court in which the question involved might arise. This question was dealt with by the House of Lords in\nEaling London Borough Council v. Race Relations Board\n, [1972] 2 W.L.R. 71. In that case it was held that the mere fact that a statute contained provisions governing the procedure for enforcement of an\nAct\ndid not oust the jurisdiction of the superior court to grant declaratory relief. See per Viscount Dilhorne at p. 79. See also per Lord Donovan at pp. 75 and 76.\"\nJustice of Appeal Thurlow, as he then was, who wrote the reasons for the Court of Appeal in the\nTeleprompter\ncase, concluded that it would be wrong to abort the proceedings prematurely by striking out the Statement of Claim. In short, it might well be within the trial judge's discretion to award the relief sought.", "006": "[6]\nThe plaintiffs' point, set out in some 35 pages of argument and many references, is that the defendants did not properly file an appeal under the\nCustoms Election Regulations\nand because they did not do so, they have not exhausted all of their remedies and thus the court has no jurisdiction. For this lack of jurisdiction the plaintiffs say the counterclaim ought to be struck out under rule 401.", "002": "[2]\nThe plaintiffs, pursuant to rule 401(c), seek to strike out the defendants' Counterclaim on the grounds that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction because the defendants did not utilize the statutory appeal procedures for elections and thus did not exhaust all of their remedies before coming to this court.", "011": "[11]\nThe plaintiffs have failed to clearly establish that no appeal was filed: on the basis of the conflicting affidavit material, I am not prepared to determine whether or not an appeal was filed.", "009": "[9]\nNancy Allison, one of the defendants, was asked on examination for discovery, at Question 222, to confirm that the appeal petition, which had been taken to the Band Office and stamped, had not been left at the Band Office. Her response was:\n\"I believe there was one there, because I knew it was there, because I was Acting Administrator at the time.\"\nShe goes on to set out the date on which she saw the petition at the office and the circumstances surrounding it. See also Questions 268 et seq. of the discovery transcript which appear to establish that there was a copy of the document referred to as the appeal which had been kept in the Band Office when it was stamped on April 27. The subject of the appeal also appears in the April 25 and April 27, 1994, Band meeting minutes.", "012": "[12]\nSecond, even assuming that the defendants ought to have exhausted an alternative remedy, that is a remedy through an Election Appeal Board, that does not end the matter, for a party need not exhaust all prior remedies where such remedies are inadequate: see for example\nHarelkin v. University of Regina\n, [1979] 3 W.W.R. 676; 26 N.R. 364, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, where Mr. Justice Beetz discussed this aspect at p. 696 et seq.

Matsqui Indian Band et al.\n, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3; 177 N.R. 325, at p. 31. In the present instance it may well be that the destruction of the ballots by one of the plaintiffs, before they were recounted, would have prevented any Election Appeal Board from doing its job and as a result the Board either might have been able to give only an inadequate remedy or might no longer have had any jurisdiction: see for example\nSaltfleet (Municipality) Board of Health v. Knapman\n, [1954] 3 D.L.R. 760 (H.C.), at p. 774, Mr. Justice Gail's reasons being approved by the Supreme Court of Canada [1956] S.C.R. 877.", "004": "[4]\nI note that the parties have recently obtained an expedited trial date, with the trial to commence June 17, 1996. The plaintiffs have been looking at the counterclaim for some 21 months. They leave it late to make an elaborate motion to strike out. In my view the plaintiffs are estopped from moving to strike out in the present instance, but ought to be required to leave the matter to the trial judge who can assess the witnesses. For this reason I would dismiss the motion. However, if I am wrong, there are three other reasons why the motion ought to be denied.", "001": "[1]\nHargrave, Prothonotary\n: In this action, commenced July 13, 1994, the plaintiffs' basic aim appears to be a declaration as to their status as Chief and Councillor following Band Council elections in March 1994.

The defendants, in their Counterclaim, which the plaintiffs now move to strike out, seek a declaration that the March 29, 1994, election for Band Council is null and void and an Order for a new election. The fact that the defendants seek a discretionary remedy has a bearing on the outcome.", "003": "[3]\nThe plaintiffs, who have produced an elaborate chronology of events, say the defendants did not file an appeal of the election result and thus failed to exercise their remedies under the\nLower Similkameen Indian Band Customs Election Regulations\n(the \"\nCustoms Election Regulations\n\"). The defendants deny this, pleading that they filed an appeal on April 27, 1994, well within the appeal period, all as required by Part VIII of the\nCustoms Election Regulations\nand point out that the issue of the filing of an appeal is at the heart of the whole case. This seems to me an issue on which a judge ought to hear witnesses at trial.\nConsideration", "007": "[7]\nThe plaintiffs' application is supported by a number of affidavits, some current, others sworn in earlier proceedings in this action. In that the present proceeding to strike out is under rule 401, on a jurisdictional point, and not under rule 419(1), as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, affidavit evidence is permissible: see\nErasmus et al. v. Minister of National Revenue\n, [1992] 2 F.C. 681; 145 N.R. 321, at p. 687 (F.C.A.)."}, "decision": "an elaborate motion to strike out at the last minute, there some six weeks before trial, is improper"}, "456": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nCourts can stop proceedings that have become unfair or oppressive, including where delay has caused significant prejudice (\nBlencoe v British Columbia\n(Human Rights Commission)\n, [2000] 2 SCR 307 at paras 101-102). In addition, they can provide a remedy where the person affected carried on with his or her life reasonably believing that no further action would be taken (\nRatzlaff v British Columbia (Medical Services Commission)\n(1996), 17 BCLR (3d) 336 (BC CA) at para 23;\nFabbiano v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)\n, 2014 FC 1219 at para 8-10).", "033": "[33]\nFurther, I see nothing unfair or improper about the same CBSA officer acting both on the inadmissibility proceedings and the cessation application. In my view, based on the officer's evidence, this is simply a practical administrative arrangement. There is no basis for any assertion that there is a conflict of interest or an improper motive underlying either proceeding, or any unfairness to Mr Li. Nor was there any breach of ethical principles, including any heightened ethical obligations applicable to government counsel. The officer explained that he acted on general instructions to proceed where the evidence supported a\nprima facie\ncase for cessation. He was not, as Mr Li alleged, acting for himself.", "046": "[46]\nMr Li argues that the Board's decision was unreasonable because it unfairly relied on the fact that he had not applied for Canadian citizenship, improperly considered his criminal record, wrongly took into account the theoretical possibility that he might have required the protection of Chinese consular officials, improperly equated trips to Hong Kong with trips to mainland China, and unduly emphasized the number of trips he made to China rather than their purposes.", "050": "[50]\nMr Li argues that the Board failed to take account of the fact that a few of his trips were to Hong Kong, an area administered separately from mainland China. His trips there, he says, cannot be used to show his re-availment of Chinese protection. However, the evidence showed that Mr Li made only four trips to Hong Kong, while he travelled to mainland China at least 13 times. On this evidence, even if the trips to Hong Kong were removed from consideration for the reason Mr Li advances, the Board's conclusion on re-availment would still be reasonable.", "037": "[37]\nIn any case, while there may be some differences between factual and legal presumptions, that is not the critical distinction here. Factual presumptions generally arise when proof of one fact is presumed to be proof of another. For example, where a person pays for something with a cheque that is later dishonoured, it is presumed that the person acquired the purchased item by false pretences. The presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the purchaser reasonably believed that he or she had sufficient funds to cover the cheque (s 362(4) of the\nCriminal Code\n, RSC 1985, c C-46).", "052": "[52]\nAccordingly, the Board's conclusion represented a defensible outcome based on the facts and the law. It was not unreasonable.\nVII.\nConclusion and Disposition", "041": "[41]\nI disagree. I believe the presumption operates as follows.", "031": "[31]\nIn my view, this change in the consequences of a cessation finding and the corresponding shift in priority does not amount to a retroactive application of the law. Nor was there an impermissible application of a new policy. There was no change to the substantive grounds on which cessation applications could be brought. Canadian law continues to reflect the cessation provisions of the Refugee Convention (\nIRPA\n, s 108). The cessation proceedings relating to Mr Li were initiated after the change in the law and, therefore, the current statutory consequences of granting the Minister's application properly apply to Mr Li - they are not being applied retroactively. The fact that proceedings were not initiated earlier is likely a product of Mr Li's lengthy incarceration. In the circumstances, I cannot conclude that the fact that the result of a cessation finding changed while he was in prison imposed an abusive, arbitrary or unfair consequence on him.", "018": "[18]\nIn 2004, the officers had to consider whether Mr Li had lost his permanent resident status by failing to be physically present in Canada for the statutory minimum period of time (\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27, ss 28, 46(1)(\nb\n) [\nIRPA\n] - enactments cited are set out in an Annex). In most cases, this is mainly an arithmetic exercise.", "040": "[40]\nMr Li argues that the Board wrongly imposed on him a burden to prove on the balance of probabilities his intent to rely on Canada's protection.", "045": "[45]\nThe Board considered all of that evidence, as well as Mr Li's testimony about the purposes of his trips. In the end, it found that Mr Li had not rebutted the presumption of re-availment. In light of the evidence before it, the Board's conclusion was the equivalent of stating the Minister had met the burden of proving re-availment on the balance of probabilities. I see no error on the Board's part.\nVI.\nIssue Four - Was the Board's decision unreasonable?", "042": "[42]\nThe Minister has the burden of proving re-availment on the balance of probabilities. In doing so, the Minister is entitled to rely on the presumption of re-availment by proving that the refugee obtained or renewed a passport from his or her country of origin. Once that has been proved, the refugee has the burden of showing that that he or she did not actually seek re-availment. As stated in the UNHCR Handbook, where there is proof that a refugee has obtained or renewed a passport \"[i]t will, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed that he intends to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality\" (para 121).", "024": "[24]\nFurther, Mr Li submits that he has been the victim of a new government policy that arbitrarily subjects persons with refugee status to unwarranted cessation proceedings. Mr Li also argues that the Minister is wrongly applying this new policy on cessation to old cases. This is equivalent, he says, to applying the law retroactively, which is impermissible.", "019": "[19]\nBy contrast, in the cessation application, the Board had to decide whether Mr Li had re-availed himself of the protection of China (\nIRPA\n, s 108(1)). As seen above, this involved the consideration of many factors - the number of trips to China and elsewhere, the reasons for those trips, the acquisition and use of Chinese passports, and Mr Li's subjective intentions. This is a qualitative exercise.", "022": "[22]\nSimilarly, I cannot agree with Mr Li's contention that the Minister should be taken to have waived the opportunity to bring cessation proceedings because the issue of cessation could have been dealt with at the same time as the decision relating to Mr Li's permanent residence status. Since the two issues are not legally connected, the proceedings relating to Mr Li's permanent residence do not indicate to me that the Minister waived the opportunity to make a cessation application. In these circumstances, the doctrine of waiver does not apply.\nIV.\nIssue Two - Do the proceedings against Mr Li amount to an abuse of process?", "029": "[29]\nIn my view, Mr Li's circumstances do not amount to an abuse of process based on delay. In the cases where courts have found an abuse of process, authorities had commenced proceedings but then had not acted on them for many years, to the person's prejudice. In\nFabbiano\n, for example, through delay, the applicant lost the opportunity to make submissions on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Here, the decision to bring a cessation application occurred in 2013, and was promptly prosecuted. Further, Mr Li has not stated what difference the allegedly missing documents would have made. Again, the facts regarding Mr Li's travel history are not in dispute. In the circumstances, I cannot see any prejudice to Mr Li.", "023": "[23]\nMr Li argues that the delay in bringing a cessation application, from 2004 to 2013, amounts to an abuse of process. The delay has prejudiced him, he says, because he failed to keep the necessary records that would have enabled him to defend himself against the Minister's application. In particular, he no longer has the documents he presented in 2004 in support of his permanent residency.", "014": "[14]\nThe Board ultimately concluded that Mr Li had not rebutted the presumption of re-availment and allowed the Minister's application for cessation of Mr Li's refugee status in Canada.\nIII.\nIssue One - Was the issue before the Board already decided?", "044": "[44]\nHere, the Minister was entitled to rely on the presumption, having proved that Mr Li had acquired a Chinese passport. However, the Minister did not rely solely on that piece of evidence; other evidence relating to re-availment was also tendered - the number of trips Mr Li made to China, his failure to apply for Canadian citizenship, his criminal record for importing controlled substances, and his travel to other countries.", "005": "[5]\nMr Li argues that the Minister's application for cessation was improper because, in effect, the same issues were already decided when the immigration officer facilitated his return to Canada in 2004. Further, he submits that the Minister's application amounts to an abuse of process given the delay in bringing it, the nature of the government policy that applies to it, and the oblique motive that lay behind it - namely, to remove him from Canada due to his criminal record. Mr Li also maintains that the Board erred by applying the wrong burden of proof, and by relying on a number of extraneous grounds, such as his failure to apply for Canadian citizenship, his criminal record, and his travel history. He asks me to quash the Board's decision and order another panel to reconsider the Minister's application.", "026": "[26]\nIn my view, there has been no abuse of process.", "055": "[55]\nMy responses to Mr Li's proposed questions are as follows:\n1. Cessation is an issue entirely separate from permanent residence and was not addressed by the officials who considered Mr Li's permanent resident status. In theory, the officials could have considered cessation, but this possibility is not sufficient to render their decisions\nres judicata\nunder these circumstances. That proposition would only apply where the cause of action is the same; that is not the case here. Therefore, the doctrine of\nres judicata\ndoes not apply here;\n2. This question is speculative, as there was no waiver;\n3. Mr Li has cited no authority for the proposition that a new policy cannot be applied to past circumstances. Therefore, this does not raise a serious question of general importance;\n4. Nothing turns on this question;\n5. And 6. No factual basis for the claim of unfairness has been made out. Therefore, no serious question of general importance arises.\nJUDGMENT", "021": "[21]\nMr Li also suggests that, in 2004, the officers must have turned their minds to the question of whether he had forfeited his refugee status and, by implication, determined that he had not. It makes no sense, he says, that a decision could be made supporting his permanent resident status when, before the deciding officer, there was evidence purportedly indicating that he had relinquished his refugee status. Further, since immigration officers in foreign posts must apply the definition of a refugee, they must also understand and apply the concept of cessation. This assertion has some logical force. However, I can see no basis for it either in the evidence, or by necessary implication. As I see it, in 2004, the officer did not address the issue of cessation, either explicitly or implicitly. The officer found that Mr Li had not lost his permanent resident status for want of physical presence in Canada and simply did not address the issue of cessation of refugee status.", "032": "[32]\nAs for the purpose of bringing the cessation application, it appears likely that Mr Li's file came to the Minister's attention based on Mr Li's criminal offences. Does that make the application improper? I do not believe so. The fact that the circumstances could have (and did) provide the Minister with other recourses (\nie\n, inadmissibility proceedings), that, in itself, does not make the cessation application abusive. The question is really whether the application is well-founded on its own merits. Why the Minister chose to make it is, at least on the facts before me, irrelevant.", "038": "[38]\nLegal presumptions generally state propositions presumed to be true and create a burden that must be met by those who seek to disprove them - a patent is presumed to be valid, unless there is some reliable evidence to the contrary (brought by the party challenging the patent); a state is presumed to be willing and able to protect its citizens, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary (presented by a refugee claimant); an accused person is presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (by the Crown). These are often more in the nature of broad legal principles, not true presumptions.", "054": "[54]\nMr Li proposed the following questions for certification:\n1. Is cessation an issue that could have been raised and therefore\nres judicata\nwhen a visa office grants a permanent resident travel document or the respondent grants a permanent resident card?\n2. Can the doctrine of waiver apply where the decision is not one to which the doctrine of\nres judicata\napplies?\n3. Does the principle that \"the power to make retroactive policies will not be inferred unless the statute requires it\" apply to the policy to give increased priority to cessation applications consequent on the changes to the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nwhich came into force on December 15, 2012?\n4. Is the presumption of re-availment on obtaining a passport an evidentiary or legal presumption?\n5. Is the duty of fairness in cessation proceedings breached where the Minister of Public Safety has sought a removal order and the Canada Border Services Agency hearings officer who is acting for the Minister in admissibility proceedings both applies to the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board for cessation and represents the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration at cessation proceedings?\n6. Is the duty of fairness in cessation proceedings breached where the Canada Border Services Agency hearings officer who exercises the delegated jurisdiction to seek cessation is the same as the officer who represents the Minister at cessation proceedings?", "017": "[17]\nIn support of this argument, Mr Li relies on the doctrine of\nres judicata\n, which requires proof that the same issue was already decided, that the earlier decision involved the same parties, and that the decision was final (\nAngle v Canada (Minister of National Revenue)\n, [1975] 2 SCR 248). I am satisfied that the subject matter addressed in the 2004 decisions did not correspond with the issues that were before the Board. Therefore, Mr Li cannot meet the first element of the test. It is unnecessary to consider the other two.", "015": "[15]\nMr Li argues that the Board erred in finding that the decisions to grant him a travel document and a permanent resident card did not preclude the Minister from bringing an application for cessation of his refugee status.", "010": "[10]\nMr Li argued before the Board that the Minister's decision not to bring cessation proceedings between 2004 and 2013 amounted to a waiver of the right to make an application. The Board disagreed, finding that Mr Li had not been prejudiced by the delay; he had not been able to show that there was evidence in his favour that was no longer available. Further, there was no real factual dispute about the number of trips Mr Li had made to China or their purposes. For similar reasons, the Board found that the delay did not amount to an abuse of process.", "008": "[8]\nThe Board rejected Mr Li's contention that the decisions in 2004 to grant him a travel document enabling him to leave Hong Kong for Canada, and to provide him later with a permanent residency card, meant that the Minister could not then seek cessation of his refugee status. Mr Li had argued that, in effect, the Minister was trying to re-litigate the same issues through cessation proceedings. The Board found otherwise; it accepted that there was an overlap of facts, but regarded the two issues as being entirely different. It pointed out that residency, re-availment, and re-establishment are separate concepts.", "035": "[35]\nMr Li points out that the presumption of re-availment is merely an evidentiary presumption that falls away in the presence of any evidence to the contrary. He contrasts it with a legal presumption that can only be defeated by proof on the balance of probabilities. He contends that the Board confused the two, and incorrectly required him to prove that he relied on Canada's protection, not China's.", "047": "[47]\nIn my view, the Board's treatment of the evidence was not unreasonable. The Board properly relied on evidence that was relevant to re-availment.", "013": "[13]\nFurther, the Board noted that Mr Li's travels to other countries - the United States, Venezuela and Thailand - also confirmed his intention to avail himself of Chinese protection. Since he was travelling on a Chinese passport, any consular assistance he might require in those countries would be provided by China, not Canada.", "039": "[39]\nThe presumption of re-availment is a factual presumption. Proof that someone obtained a passport creates a presumption that the person re-availed himself or herself of the protection of the issuing state. However, as mentioned, it is not the classification of the presumption that really matters. The real question relates to the quantum of evidence required to defeat it.", "056": "[56]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is denied, and no serious question of general importance arises.\nApplication dismissed.", "006": "[6]\nI can overturn the Board's decision only if I find that it erred in law or arrived at an unreasonable conclusion.", "043": "[43]\nMr Li relies on a statement in a legal article on cessation in which the authors state that the \"benefit of the doubt must be given to the refugee, as is consistent with the restrictive interpretation appropriate to the cessation clauses\" (Joan Fitzpatrick and Rafael Bonoan, \"Cessation of Refugee Protection\" in Erika Feller, Volker T\u00fcrk and Frances Nicholson, eds,\nRefugee Protection in International Law: UNHCR's Global Consultations on International Protection\n(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003) 491 at 525). However, just above that statement, the authors actually cite the UNHCR Handbook which clearly places a legal burden on refugees to rebut the presumption of re-availment on a balance of probabilities. In that context, I take the authors to mean that refugees should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether they have rebutted the presumption. They do not say that refugees merely have to raise a doubt about re-availment.", "020": "[20]\nObviously, some common facts would be relevant to both processes, particularly Mr Li's travel history. However, that does not mean the issues were the same.", "002": "[2]\nThe Minister's application was based on the fact that Mr Li obtained Chinese passports after he had acquired permanent resident status in Canada. In addition, Mr Li has made frequent trips to China over the years. He met and married his wife in China, and the couple carried on business there through Mr Li's Canadian company. Mr Li actually resided primarily in China for significant periods of time during 2000 to 2004.", "048": "[48]\nThe fact that Mr Li had not applied for Canadian citizenship indicated his intention, based on his possession of a Chinese passport, to avail himself of China's protection instead. Mr Li's explanation for his failure to apply for citizenship - that he was too busy - was reasonably considered and dismissed by the Board.", "053": "[53]\nFor the reasons above, I must dismiss this application for judicial review.", "049": "[49]\nLikewise, the Board considered Mr Li's criminal history simply as a possible explanation for the fact that Mr Li ceased travelling to China. It did not contradict Mr Li's presumed re-availment to China.", "011": "[11]\nDealing with the merits of the Minister's application, the Board found it significant that Mr Li had not applied for Canadian citizenship but, rather, decided to maintain his Chinese citizenship through renewal of his Chinese passport. The Board found that Mr Li's conduct showed his intention to avail himself of Chinese, rather than Canadian, protection. It referred to the UNHCR Handbook which states that evidence that a refugee has applied for and obtained a passport creates a presumption that the person intends to re-avail himself or herself of the protection of the issuing state. The person's intention can also be presumed from numerous visits to his or her country of origin. The Board accepted Mr Li's explanation that he initially obtained a Chinese passport in order to travel to the United States, and that one of his trips to China was for the purpose of visiting his sick mother-in-law. However, Mr Li had made at least 17 trips to China for various purposes, including business ventures.", "034": "[34]\nMr Li cites concerns about the new policy, namely, that the increased priority given to cessation cases means that persons with only a fleeting connection with their countries of origin are being targeted and, potentially, removed from Canada. That may be a valid concern generally, but not in this case. As mentioned, Mr Li's travels to and connections with his country of origin were extensive, and reasonably motivated the Minister's cessation application, as well as the Board's decision in the Minister's favour.\nV.\nIssue Three - Did the Board apply the wrong burden of proof?", "009": "[9]\nThe Board also rejected Mr Li's suggestion that the cessation proceedings were being used inappropriately as a substitute for inadmissibility proceedings, the latter being the usual mechanism for the removal of persons for criminality. While the Minister may have had other available remedies, the Board determined that its role was simply to rule on the merits of the cessation application.", "012": "[12]\nThe Board noted that the reason Mr Li had not returned to China after 2004 was because he had been arrested in Canada in August of that year, and was subsequently convicted and sentenced for producing, importing, and possessing controlled substances. He served a sentence of more than two years for those offences, and was later subject to parole conditions that prevented him from travelling. Based on this evidence, the Board concluded that Mr Li could not credibly claim that his trips to China were all for legitimate business purposes.", "028": "[28]\nWhether delay amounts to an abuse of process justifying a stay of proceedings depends on all of the circumstances (\nBlencoe\nat para 122). The test is whether the delay caused \"actual prejudice of such magnitude that the public's sense of decency and fairness is affected\" (at para 133).", "030": "[30]\nOn the matter of alleged retroactive application of a new policy, the evidence shows that the law on cessation of refugee status changed in 2012. Pursuant to the amendment, persons whose refugee status has ceased also lose their permanent residence status (\nIRPA\n, s 46(1)(\nc\n.1)). Along with that change came increased funding for cessation applications. In turn, cessation applications were given somewhat higher priority within the Canadian Border Services Agency.", "051": "[51]\nFurther, the Board specifically considered the purposes of Mr Li's trips to China - to visit family and to conduct business - as well as the number of trips. I cannot find that the Board ignored the purposes of Mr Li's trips.", "036": "[36]\nIt is tempting to agree with \"the assertion that 'presumption' is the slipperiest member of the family of legal terms, except its first cousin 'burden of proof'\" (Edward W Cleary, ed,\nMcCormick on Evidence\n, 3rd ed, (West Publishing Co: St Paul, Minnesota, 1984) at \u00a7342). Presumptions defy rigid classification; indeed, the term \"presumption\" is often misused. There are, however, some differences between what are often referred to as \"factual presumptions\" and \"legal presumptions\".", "004": "[4]\nBased on this information, the Minister argued, in 2013, that Mr Li had re-availed himself of China's protection and had become re-established as a Chinese resident. The Board concluded that Mr Li had re-availed himself, and did not address the issue of re-establishment.", "025": "[25]\nIn addition, Mr Li maintains that the proceedings are abusive because they have been brought for an oblique purpose - to remove him from Canada due to his criminal record. To do so, he says, the Minister must rely on inadmissibility proceedings, not a cessation application. Mr Li also argues that he has been treated unfairly because the same CBSA officer acted both in the inadmissibility proceedings brought against him and the cessation application. Since the officer initiated the cessation proceedings on his own motion, Mr Li maintains that the officer effectively represented himself in those proceedings.", "001": "[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: Mr Peter Sum Li, a citizen of the People's Republic of China, achieved refugee status in Canada in 1990. Two years later, he became a permanent resident. In 2013, the Minister of Public Safety applied to the Immigration and Refugee Board to cease the refugee protection provided to Mr Li. The Board granted the Minister's application and nullified Mr Li's refugee status.", "016": "[16]\nI disagree.", "003": "[3]\nAt the time of his departure from China, in 2004, an immigration officer in Hong Kong interviewed Mr Li about his Canadian permanent residence status based on concerns about the amount of time he was spending in China.

The officer provided Mr Li a travel document allowing him to return to Canada, where he later acquired his permanent resident card.", "007": "[7]\nI can find no grounds for quashing the Board's decision and must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review.

For the applicant, that period was from June 5 to December 5, 1990, and his injuries were incurred during that posting. Vote 58A and the\nPension Act\nshould be read in harmony. Since the applicant was posted in a Special Duty Area, since s. 21(1)(f) explicitly excludes from pension entitlement certain types of leave, and since s. 10(5) of the\nVeterans Appeal Board Act\nand s. 108 of the\nPension Act\nprovide that in case of doubt the decision should favour the claimant, the applicant should be entitled to a pension.\n2. The applicant was granted a 60 hour pass, which Canadian Forces policy deems to be duty time as opposed to leave time.

The applicant's Commandant confirmed that the 60 hour pass authorized leave from November 10 to November 13, 1990, while the three day UN Leave extended it from November 14 to November 16, 1990. Since the accident occurred on November 13, 1990, it happened specifically during the first 60 hour leave that he had been granted. A 60 hour pass is considered, according to Canadian Armed Forces policy, to be duty time.

If the member is on leave without pay, for example, the authorities have no control over his activities. But if the member is granted leave with pay from his posting or duties, and the authorities have full knowledge of, or consent to his activities, he is, though not on duty, still in service. Further, if the activities of the member, while on his leisure time, are influenced by his superiors' orders, as was the case in\nCh\u00e9nier\n, the member is in service.", "053": "[53]\nVote 58A states that the\nPension Act\nshall apply \"in respect of\" service in a designated area.

What does being in \"military service\" imply or include? The\nPension Act\nprovides no helpful guide, as s. 3(1) defines the term as such:\n\"3(1) 'military service' or 'service' means service in the Canadian Forces or in the naval, army or air forces of Canada since the commencement of World War I;\"", "062": "[62]\nI should think that the awarding of a lump sum for costs would be of a nature to bring matters to an expeditious conclusion.

It is reasonable to conclude the claimant could return to St. Lucia and live as he was living without a serious possibility of being persecuted by society.", "003": "[3]\nI have concluded that the judicial review should be dismissed for the reasons that follow.\nBackground", "007": "[7]\nThe RPD found as a fact that the assailant had no further interest in the Applicant since 2002. It found that the Applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. It reviewed country documentation and concluded that while there was discrimination against homosexuals and some violence, police did investigate such offences. Finally, the RPD decided that a s. 97 analysis was not required.\nLegislation"}, "decision": "The question of whether a fear of persecution is well-founded is a question of mixed fact and law and, as such, it is reviewable using the reasonableness standard"}, "451": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nIn written submissions in advance of the hearing, referred to briefly by counsel for the applicant when the matter was heard, it was urged that the PCDO erred in law in interpretation of the definition of the PDRCC class set out in s. 2(1) of the\nRegulations\nby referring to the absence of evidence of the authorities in El Salvador acting against former FMLN sympathizers. The applicant inferred from this that the PCDO implied that risk must be due to \"authorities\" of a country, a limitation not set out in the definition. However, as the respondent points out, the PCDO Decision Record also refers to the applicant's concerns about possible action by former FMLN sympathizers against him, and it specifically notes that the applicant's fears about activities and powers of former FMLN sympathizers is not supported by evidence.", "033": "[33]\nIn summary, I am not persuaded that any of the grounds urged, on behalf of the applicant for judicial review, are established. There is no basis on which this court's intervention to set aside the decision of the PCDO would be warranted.", "037": "[37]\nIn recognition of the importance of judicial comity in respect of decisions of my colleagues, and of the importance of treating similarly persons who are in similar circumstances but in different cases, in my view it is appropriate in this case to certify a question similar in terms to the question proposed in\nNadarajah\nand the other cases referred to, concerning failure to disclose in advance of a decision information relied upon from public sources. Determination of that question by the Court of Appeal in any of the other cases will, in effect, dispose of any appeal under s. 83 in this case, subject to any requirement for a formal order of the Court of Appeal to dispose of an appeal if one be initiated.", "031": "[31]\nIt is well settled that a decision maker, here the PCDO, does not have to discuss every claim or every aspect of evidence before him in setting out the basis for his or her decision. Here there was no evidence that the army officer the applicant feared had ever sought out the applicant before he left El Salvador, and no evidence that officer was still alive now some eight years after the incident the applicant witnessed.", "018": "[18]\nFor the applicant it is urged that the principle of disclosure and an opportunity to know and to address the case to be met is as significant in the context of determining a PDRCC claim as it is in criminal law as enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nR. v. Stinchcombe\n, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326; 130 N.R. 277; 120 A.R. 161; 8 W.A.C. 161; 68 C.C.C.(3d) 1. I am not persuaded that the principle of disclosure of evidence against an accused prior to trial is applicable in regard to documentary evidence of country conditions drawn from public documents readily available to an applicant in refugee or related claims such as a PDRCC claim.", "040": "[40]\nI conclude that the questions proposed by the applicant concerning the methodology of risk assessment, should not be certified under s. 83(1) of the\nAct\n. The first question proposed by the applicant, is certified in terms similar to those proposed in\nNadarajah\n, as follows:\n\"Does an immigration officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violate the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in\nShah\n, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions?\"\nOrder accordingly.", "024": "[24]\nIt may assist applicants and their counsel if departmental manuals that do describe the process and methodology are readily available to them. That would be in keeping with apparent departmental practice in relation to other decisions to be made under the\nAct\n. The court would encourage general disclosure of information, on country conditions, and on processes to be followed in assessing claims, in letters of advice to prospective applicants at least by reference to sources where the information may be obtained.", "019": "[19]\nIn\nNadarajah\nRothstein, J., noted that it would be reasonable practice for a PCDO to inform an applicant of documentary evidence of country conditions that is being considered, but failure to do so, unless that evidence is not public and is material to the decision, does not breach the rules of procedural fairness. That reasoning has been accepted by Mr. Justice Heald in\nXavier v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1996), 120 F.T.R. 130 (T.D.) and by Mr. Justice Gibson in\nGarcia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1996), 122 F.T.R. 37 (T.D.). Fairness dictates that documents or other evidence not readily available to the public ought to be disclosed, but it does not require more. In particular, it does not require that, before a decision of a PCDO, there be disclosure of specific documents that are in the public domain and available to an applicant upon which the PCDO may rely for evidence of current country conditions.", "022": "[22]\nBy analogy, based on\nClarke v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1996), 123 F.T.R. 277 (T.D.), per Wetston, J., which deals with the issue of the necessity for reasons for a decision under s. 70(5) of the\nAct\n, counsel for the applicant urged in written submissions following the hearing in this case that reasons of the PCDO in a decision concerning membership in the PDRCC class should demonstrate a \"risk assessment methodology ... substantially rational and rationally connected to the social-scientific field of risk assessment methodology\".", "029": "[29]\nThe applicant's final concern is that the PCDO ignored or treated in a capricious manner facts concerning the targeting by various death squads of FMLN and former FMLN members and the inability of the El Salvador government to prevent or bring to justice those responsible for death threats, injuries or deaths of former FMLN members, like himself. It is true there were reports before the PCDO which would support a scene of uncontrolled violence inflicted on some former FMLN members; there were other reports which highlighted improvements from that grim picture and which supported the PCDO's conclusions, inter alia, that there was no evidence that authorities target former FMLN sympathizers and scant evidence that FMLN members seek to settle old suspicions in a violent manner, or that they control strategic travel centres as the applicant feared. Moreover, the relatively minor role of the applicant within the FMLN, the lack of evidence, despite his fears, that his name had in fact been reported to authorities, more than six years earlier before he left El Salvador, the lack of any claim that authorities or FMLN sympathizers had tried to do anything to him before he left or had harassed his family since then, by inference, support the PCDO's conclusion that he could return to El Salvador and not be at risk.", "023": "[23]\nI am not persuaded that the duty of fairness extends to disclosure of a methodology for risk assessment that would be accepted by theoreticians or academics concerned with risk assessment theory and practice. Nor am I persuaded that uncertainties and a measure of those as they may be recognized in seeking to assess risks for purposes of the PDRCC class should be disclosed, as counsel for the applicant suggests. Risk assessment is not an exact science, even for actuaries and mathematicians whose vocations may be in professional work of measuring comparative risks. Risk assessment by a PCDO is not of that sort. I am not convinced that it was intended to be more than a reasonable assessment, objectively done in the sense that it is done with reference to the evidence that may be available in all the circumstances, of serious risk to life or liberty of the individual claimant.", "014": "[14]\nIn my opinion, the materials here listed as consulted by the PCDO are publications available to the public, particularly to those knowledgeable about the processing of refugee claims, appeals, applications for leave and for judicial review, and of PDRCC applications. In all these proceedings reference is generally made to reports on country conditions, and those reports are generally from public sources and maintained and accessible through files, indexes and records available from or through the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. If the citations for some such documents appear obscure to the applicant that is unfortunate. I note that here submissions of the applicant himself, for inclusion in the PDRCC class, included an excerpt from Central America Report (CA Report, in the Decision of the PCDO), from Inter/Press Service (IPS Report, in that Decision), and two publications of the Question and Answer Series published by the I.R.B. for April 1994 and for March 1995 each of which has an extensive reference list of Central America Reports, of the Inter Press Service, of Agence France Press (AFP).", "005": "[5]\nBy letter of February 8, 1996 the applicant was informed that as a result of a post claim review, conducted in accord with\nImmigration Regulations\n, to assess what, if any, risk he would face if he were returned to El Salvador, it was determined that he was not a member of the PDRCC class. The reasons for that decision are set out in a three page document titled \"PCDO Decision Record\", a copy of which was sent to the applicant with the letter of February 8, 1996. It is that decision which this application seeks to have set aside.\nIssues", "026": "[26]\nThus, it is my opinion in this case that the failure to disclose information concerning the methodology or principles for risk assessment does not warrant intervention of the court.\nInterpretation Of The PDRCC Class", "021": "[21]\nPost hearing submissions of the applicant were extensive, with counsel reviewing two major academic discussions of risk assessment methodology. On the basis of those counsel offered a critique of the risk assessment methodology as that appears or is inferred from the draft manual. I expect that submission should be of interest to policy, planning and training officers of the respondent. From my perspective, it does not concentrate on the matter raised at the hearing, that is, the significance of any failure to disclose in advance of the PCDO's decision in this case, the methodology of risk assessment followed in determination of claims to be included in the PDRCC class. The post hearing submission does note that in the draft manual emphasis is placed on the duty to disclose information or evidence to be relied upon by a PCDO that is not readily available to the public.", "032": "[32]\nI am not persuaded that the PCDO's failure to refer to this aspect of the applicant's expressed fears warrants intervention by this court, or that it was not considered by the PCDO.\nConclusion", "038": "[38]\nI am not persuaded that the second aspect raised by the applicant's proposed questions, that is, in regard to disclosure of documents on methodology and theoretical principles to be followed in risk assessment for considering applicants for the PDRCC class, raises \"a serious question of general importance\" within the meaning of those words in s. 83(1) of the\nAct\n. The questions proposed concern the application of an established principle to a new aspect of matters before the decision maker, that is, the necessity to disclose \"extrinsic evidence\", but application of that principle to methodology of decision making, rather than to evidence, does not, in my opinion, constitute \"a serious question of general importance\" within s. 83(1). Moreover, here no request was made by the applicant, in connection with his PDRCC application, for information on methods of risk assessment. No argument was here advanced about a different decision in this case if the manual or guidelines had been provided by the PCDO in advance with an opportunity to make submissions about them. In my opinion, the questions suggested in relation to disclosure of the method of risk assessment are hypothetical, that is, without a basis in the facts of this case that could lead to a different outcome were the Court of Appeal to answer affirmatively the questions posed by the applicant. Answering the questions as posed, in the circumstances of this case, would not dispose of this case. (See\nLiyanagamage v.

I discount one of those, the\nNational Geographic\nfor September/95, since one of the excerpts on country conditions included in the applicant's own submissions of September 11 is from that same publication. The other three documents are admittedly not from sources available to the applicant at the time of his submissions, and thus they were documents on which he could not have commented unless they were brought to his attention after his application and before the PCDO's decision. Yet they are not documents which are significant in themselves for purposes of the PCDO's decision. They introduce no new information that is not readily available from the other documents listed from published sources available to the public before the application was made. In my opinion, reference to those three documents does not constitute a breach of the duty of fairness that would in itself warrant intervention by the court.", "015": "[15]\nIn circumstances where the applicant is aware of a general process of relying on published documentary sources of information on country conditions, as the applicant here must be deemed to have been, and where he supplied some information of that sort with his application, I cannot conclude that the information referred to by the PCDO was beyond the ambit of publicly available information that a reasonable applicant, advised by counsel, as the applicant was, would anticipate that the PCDO would consider in reaching his decision.", "010": "[10]\nI turn to each of the general issues in turn.\nDocumentary Evidence Relied Upon\nBy The PCDO And Its Disclosure", "008": "[8]\nThe second general issue concerns the interpretation by the PCDO of the definition of the PDRCC class under the\nRegulations\n, in particular the interpretation of the sources of risk to the applicant if he were to be returned to El Salvador.", "035": "[35]\nCounsel for the applicant urges that certain questions be certified for consideration by the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 83(1) of the\nAct\n.

In the latter case, where documentary evidence of country conditions considered in a PDRCC assessment is material that is publicly available, Rouleau, J., held there was no obligation to inform the applicant, in advance of a decision, of specific documents concerning country conditions that are being considered. That same principle was applied in\nNadarajah\nby Rothstein, J., and in my view it is applicable here, at least with reference to documents published and available from public sources prior to the date of any submission by the applicant.", "039": "[39]\nWhile it may be possible to persuade a court that methods adopted for discharge of statutory functions are irrelevant or without any merit for the statutory purposes for which the methods are adopted, that is not here established, and in those circumstances merit must be assumed for the method adopted by the Minister for discharge of his statutory responsibilities.", "006": "[6]\nThe decision of the Post Claims Determination Officer (the \"PCDO\") is said by the applicant to raise three general issues.", "020": "[20]\nThe argument for disclosure is made more strongly in relation to the methodology and principles that underlie the risk assessment faced by those claiming to be within the PDRCC class.

In\nBaker\n, supra, the Supreme court held tat paragraph 70 that the human rights values in these international conventions 'help inform the contextual approach' which the Court should incorporate when interpreting statutes. However, s. 3(3)(f) of\nIRPA\ndoes not incorporate international human rights conventions as part of Canadian law, or state that they override plain words in a statute. Section 3(3)(f) of\nIRPA\nmeans that the conventions be considered by the Court as 'context' when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the immigration law (at para. 53).\"", "033": "[33]\nIndeed, the Supreme Court of Canada did not go that far in\nBaker\n. In her decision, Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 explicitly recognized that the H & C decision is an important one since it not only affects the future of individuals' lives in a fundamental manner, but \"it may also have an important impact on the lives of any Canadian children of the person whose humanitarian and compassionate application is being considered, since they may be separated from one of their parents and/or uprooted from their country of citizenship, where they have settled and have connections\" (supra, at para. 15). This is a clear recognition that a child can be separated from his parent as a result of a negative H & C decision.", "037": "[37]\nHaving said all of this, if the best interest of the child is to be taken seriously, some consideration must be given to their fate when one or both of their parents are to be removed from this country. As is often the case, I believe that the solution lies somewhere in between the two extreme positions espoused by the parties. While an absolute bar on the removal of the parent would not be warranted, an approach precluding the removals officers to give any consideration to the situation of a child would equally be unacceptable.", "041": "[41]\nIn the present case, the two kids of the applicant are very young, and nobody seems prepared to care for them besides their mother. Yet, she cannot take them with her since her application for an order seeking sole custody has not yet been dealt with. Therefore, I conclude that the applicant has raised a serious question, even on the more probing standard required in a case like this one, when claiming that the removals officer failed to exercise her discretion appropriately and was not \"alert, alive and sensitive\" to the childrens' best interests.", "031": "[31]\nThe case law of this Court is divided as to whether a removals officer is under an obligation to consider the best interests of a child when assessing if it is reasonably practicable for a removal order to be executed. In some cases, such an obligation has been flatly rejected (see, for example,\nJohn et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2003] F.C.J. No. 583; 231 F.T.R. 248 (T.D.);\nMensah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 47; 2004 FC 78), while in other cases, the absence of clear evidence as to the impact of the removal on the child was also relied on as a justification not to disturb the decision of the officer to proceed with the removal (see, for example,\nBuchting v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 538; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1216 (F.C.);\nParsons v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2003] F.T.R.

What he should be considering, however, are the short term best interests of the child. For example, it is certainly within the removal officer's discretion to defer removal until a child has terminated his or her school year, if he or she is going with his or her parent. Similarly, I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the removal officer should not satisfy himself that provisions have been made for leaving a child in the care of others in Canada when parents are to be removed. This is clearly within his mandate, if s. 48 of the\nIRPA\nis to be read consistently with the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child\n. To make enquiries as to whether a child will be adequately looked after does not amount to a fulsome H & C assessment and in no way duplicates the role of the immigration officer who will eventually deal with such an application (see\nBoniowski et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 671; [2004] F.C.J.

The evidence clearly shows that the situation of these children would be at best precarious, since neither their father nor the Applicant's current partner seem prepared to nurture them on a long term basis, let alone provide them with a loving and stable environment. Such a clear infringement of the best interests of a child and of its most basic human rights must necessarily constitute an irreparable harm.", "024": "[24]\nAccordingly, she came to the conclusion that it would be contrary to the\nConvention\nto use the provisions of the\nIRPA\nto separate the Applicant and his children before a decision is made on the H & C application, because it is only during the assessment of that application that the best interest of the children can be fully addressed and treated as a primary consideration. She therefore found that there was a serious issue in the case as to whether the existence of the undecided H & C application is a bar to the removal of the Applicant because the completion of the H & C assessment is required to fulfill Canada's\nConvention\nobligation.", "019": "[19]\nThis is obviously a very sad and heartbreaking story, from a human perspective. On the other hand, one can easily understand the exasperation and frustration of immigration officials, in light of the Applicant's obvious attempts to circumvent the law and to use every means at her disposal to prevent her removal from the country. But there is more at stake, as the interests of two innocent bystanders also have to be taken into consideration.", "022": "[22]\nIt is with this standard in mind that I will now proceed with an analysis of the first leg of the\nToth\ntest. Counsel for the Applicant contends that there is a duty on the enforcement officer to consider the best interests of the children when the removal of a parent is being arranged. She argued that Mrs. Farrauto refused to defer the removal, despite awareness that there were no travel documents as yet for the children and that the mother was seeking sole custody so that the children can go with her if she must leave. It was submitted that the Officer has not demonstrated that she has been alive, alert and sensitive to the best interests of the children, and has not made any inquiries as to what would happen to the children if they could not leave with their mother.", "029": "[29]\nSection 48(2) of\nIRPA\nstates that \"if a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable\". There is general agreement that this leaves the removals officer with very little discretion. As Justice Nadon said in\nSimoes et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2000] F.C.J. No. 936; 187 F.T.R. 219 (T.D.), at para. 12:\n\"In my opinion, the discretion that a removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is 'reasonably practicable' for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to traveling, and pending H & C applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved due to backlogs in the system.\"", "023": "[23]\nMuch has been made of the decision reached by this Court in\nMartinez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 799; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1695 (F.C.), where my colleague Justice Simpson found that where a parent is being removed and the children are remaining in Canada, the removals officer should defer the removal pending the outcome of the H & C application in order to give effect to Canada's obligations under Article 1 of the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child\n. Justice Simpson was of the view that s. 3(3)(f) of the\nIRPA\nhas \"incorporated\" the\nConvention\ninto our domestic law \"to the extent that the\nIRPA\nmust be construed and applied in a manner that is consistent with the\nConvention\n\". This\nConvention\ndeals with the rights of children and recognizes in its preamble that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance.", "014": "[14]\nThe Applicant failed to report to Immigration officials on October 22, 2004.

As explained by Justice Pelletier in\nWang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(2001), 204 F.T.R. 5; 2001 FCT 148, at para. 10, this higher threshold is justified where the result of the interlocutory motion will in essence amount to a final determination of the action:\n\"The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the test of 'serious issue to be tried' is simply that the issue being raised is one which is not frivolous.\nR.J.R. MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, at paragraph 44. On the other hand, to succeed in the underlying judicial review, the applicant will have to show that the decision not to defer was subject to review for error of law, jurisdictional error, factual error made capriciously, or denial of natural justice:\nFederal Court Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, s. 18.1(4) [as enacted by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5]. The result is that if the stay is granted, the relief sought will have been obtained on a finding that the question raised is not frivolous. If the stay is not granted and the matter proceeds to the application for judicial review, the applicant will have to demonstrate a substantive ground upon which the relief sought should be awarded. The structure of the process allows the applicant to obtain his/her relief on a lower standard on the interlocutory application, notwithstanding the fact that the relief is the same as that sought in [page 692] the judicial review application. It is this congruence of the relief sought in the interlocutory and the final application which leads me to conclude that if the same relief is sought, it ought to be obtained on the same basis in both applicaitons. I am therefore of the view that where a motion for a stay is made from a removal officer's refusal to defer removal, the judge hearing the motion ought not simply apply the 'serious issue' test, but should go further and closely examine the merits of the underlying application.\"", "032": "[32]\nThere is obviously a certain degree of discomfort with an absolute bar on the removal of a parent with Canadian children pending the determination of their H & C application.

While a full-fledged analysis is required in the context of an H & C application, a less thorough examination may be sufficient when other types of decisions are made. Because of s. 48 of the\nAct\nand of its overall structure, I would also agree with her that the obligation of a removals officer to consider the interests of Canadian-born children must rest at the lower end of the spectrum (\nJohn v.

She explained that another lawyer was seeking an order for the Applicant to have sole custody of the children, and that the father was cooperating. She also indicated that the father was trying to obtain the children's birth certificates, so that they could travel with her.", "015": "[15]\nThe Applicant failed to appear for a new removal interview on November 9, 2004 and an arrest warrant was issued against her on November 17, 2004.

Factors related to the emotional, social, cultural and physical well-being of the child are to be taken into consideration. Examples of factors that can be taken into account include the age of the child, the level of dependency between the child and the H & C applicant, the degree of the child's establishment in Canada, the child's links to the country in relation to which the H & C decision is being considered, the medical issues or special needs the child may have, the impact to the child's education, and matters related to the child's gender.

T.S. 1992 No. 3 which not only addresses the best interests of children at article 3(1), but also envisions the possibility of separation of children from their parents in the context of detention, deportation, imprisonment, or death. As Article 9(4) of the\nConvention\nstipulates:\n'Where such separation [of children from their parents] results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child.

Not only would that result in a \"pre H & C\" application\", to use the words of Justice Nadon in\nSimoes\n, but it would also duplicate to some extent the real H & C assessment. More importantly, removals officers have no jurisdiction or delegated authority to determine applications for permanent residence submitted under s. 25 of the\nIRPA\n.

This section would be no more than a codification of the canon of statutory interpretation that says that, as far as possible, domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with international obligations.

Canada et al.\n(1992), 57 O.A.C. 272; 9 O.R.(3d) 495 (C.A.), decided August 6, 1992. That case concerned the application of the same interim policy of the Canadian Armed Forces as in issue in the action of Ms. Douglas. There the motions judge had allowed an application and granted a declaration that the \"absence of sexual orientation from the list or proscribed grounds of discrimination in s. 3(1) of the\nCanadian Human Rights Act\nis discriminatory as being contrary to the guarantee of equal benefit of the law set out in s. 15 of the\nCharter\n\" (\nHaig v. Canada\n(1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 245 at 248 (Gen. Div.) per McDonald, J.). On appeal, counsel for the Crown conceded that sexual orientation is an analogous ground to those expressly set out in s. 15(1) of the\nCharter\n. The Court of Appeal held that the omission of sexual orientation as a proscribed ground of discrimination under s. 3(1) of the\nCanadian Human Rights Act\n, and the resulting failure to provide an avenue for redress, with the possible inference from the omission that discriminatory treatment based on sexual orientation is acceptable, created and effect of discrimination contrary to s. 15(1) of the\nCharter\n.

Canada\n(1992), 139 N.R. 1; 10 C.R.R.(2d) 1 (S.C.C.) the Court of Appeal found that the appropriate remedy was reading in, which it directed by a declaration that the\nAct\nbe interpreted and applied as though it included sexual orientation as a proscribed ground of discrimination. In effect the Ontario Court of Appeal reached a result that the Federal Court of Appeal declined to reach in\nMossop\n, supra, and Muldoon, J., declined to reach in\nNeilsen\n, supra.

In the ordinary course of settlement of issues that are the subject of litigation between private parties the court called upon to play a role in that settlement by pronouncing a judgment on consent of the parties does not look beyond the terms of judgment agreed upon, provided the relief granted is within the scope of that prayed for in pleadings and might have been granted after trial of the action. If that is the case, the court does not have any duty to question a consent by the parties to the judgment, even where the Crown is one of the parties represented by its legal advisors (\nGalway v. M.N.R.\n, [1974] 1 F.C. 600 (C.A.), reconsidering [1974] 1 F.C. 593 (C.A.)). Rule 340 of this court's\nRules\nprovides that where there is an attorney or solicitor on the record for the defendant, no judgment shall be given by consent unless the consent of the defendant is given by that attorney or solicitor. That rule was met on this occasion with the joint submission of counsel for both parties that judgment be granted in the terms agreed upon between them. The only other limitation on possible judgments on consent, apparent from some of the jurisprudence of this court, concerns consent judgments against the crown for the payment of money, including judgments in relation to the amount of compensation to be paid under the\nExpropriation Act\n, where cases suggest that at the very least the court should be satisfied that the facts and the law warrant the conclusion represented by the judgment (See, e.g.\nElliott v.

The court declined to consider that limiting \"family status\" as excluding homosexual relationships, constituted discrimination prohibited under the\nAct\n, which did not expressly prohibit discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Assuming (without deciding this issue) that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was prohibited under s. 15(1) of the\nCharter\n, the court found this would not permit reading into the\nHuman Rights Act\nsuch a proscription which that\nAct\ndid not include.", "019": "[19]\nIn an action for a declaration and other relief against federal government officers, where counsel jointly submitted a proposed consent judgment for a declaration that a long standing renewable contract concluded by a Minister of the Crown, and an order in council approving that agreement, were invalid as beyond the statutory authority of the Minister and the Governor-in-Council, I ordered that detailed written submissions of counsel for the Crown that supported the conclusion set out in the judgment be signed and filed as admissions. In that case the application for judgment was pursuant to rule 341, providing for such an application in respect of any matter upon any admission in the pleadings or other documents filed in the court. Because of the terms of that rule and because the contract in question was between the Minister and a third party, who had notice but was not represented at the hearing, it seemed to me important that the court's record be complete by filed admissions on behalf of the respondents that supported the conclusions of the judgment granted on consent (\nCanadian Parks and Wilderness Society v.

The Commission had held action on the complaint pending determination by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nMossop\n, supra, whether the Commission's jurisdiction should be interpreted to proscribe discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The\nCanadian Human Rights Act\ndid not, and does not now, expressly prohibit discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation.

This was initiated because it was believed the plaintiff accessed and reviewed a classified report and divulged information regarding the contents of the report, contrary to security procedures. On April 4, 1989, a security clearance review board recommended that, because of a demonstrated disregard for security regulations and apparent strong loyalty to members of the homosexual community, the plaintiff be denied any level of security clearance. This recommendation was approved on April 17 and on April 20 the plaintiff was advised that her security clearance had been revoked. On May 25 a career review board was convened to consider the effect of this decision on the plaintiff's career and it recommended that she be released from the Canadian Forces since she was not employable because of the loss of her security clearance, a recommendation approved on June 16, 1989. No action was taken directly in relation to this recommendation since the plaintiff was then in the process of being released pursuant to the Canadian Forces interim policy.", "013": "[13]\nOne week before trial was scheduled to commence, counsel for the parties advised the court that they expected this action would be settled on agreed terms, which it was proposed would not become part of the record except for a judgment which might include declaratory relief.

While the exercise of discretion to grant the second of the declarations might have required more persuasive argument, for that declaration deals with general policies of the defendant within the Canadian Armed Forces and not merely with the plaintiff's rights as affected by the application of those policies, since the general application of those policies in light of the\nCharter\nwas clearly in issue, the second of the declarations would have been within the court's discretion to grant after trial, had it been held.", "030": "[30]\nThe question of the appropriate role of the executive branch of government, represented by the Attorney General of Canada, in the resolution of\nCharter\nissues raised in litigation, with particular regard to consenting to judgment, is left for consideration in a case where evolving jurisprudence is even less definitive of the rights in issue, and the judgment sought is more questionable than, in my view, is the case in this action.\nOrder accordingly.", "004": "[4]\nThe plaintiff joined the Armed Forces on November 26, 1986, as a direct entry officer.

In both\nBavi\nand\nShahranpour\n, as here, a considerable amount of time had passed since the refugee determination; the conditions in the country at the time of the hearing of the application for a stay, and the documentary evidence in support thereof, are what matters. As Nadon, J., did on the evidence before him in\nShahranpour\n, I find also that there is insufficient evidence that the Iranian regime punishes those convicted of drug-related offences in Canada to the extent advanced on behalf of the applicant. However, beyond these considerations, the factual basis for this applicant's claim to irreparable harm is not the same as in\nBavi\nand\nShahranpour\n. I find that there was adduced before me sufficient evidence that the applicant could come to irreparable harm if returned to Iran, as a result either of his desertion from the army, or because of his conversion to Christianity, or both, particularly when those factors are considered together with his refugee status and criminal record.", "019": "[19]\nThe balance of convenience, considering the risk of irreparable harm to the applicant, also lies in his favour. Although there will be an element of inconvenience to the respondent if this stay is granted, and I acknowledge that there is a public interest in having the respondent's duties under the\nAct\nfulfilled in a timely manner, I find the balance to lie in the applicant's favour. I note that while the deportation order was issued in respect of the applicant in November of 1994, the process which led to the issuing of the Minister's opinion was not implemented until September of 1995, and the opinion was not communicated to the applicant until 28 March, 1996. On the facts before me, I find that the balance of convenience lies in favour of the granting of a stay, until the application for leave and for judicial review has been dealt with.", "014": "[14]\nI am also concerned that the foregoing quotation from\nNguyen\nrelated to an opinion formed in a different context, one relating to an individual who arrived in Canada without status, but alleging entitlement to Convention refugee status, as opposed to one relating to an individual with landed or permanent resident status on the basis of a UNHCR determination of refugee status.

On the material before me, including the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent, I am satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried with regard to the validity of the Minister's opinion. The affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent attempted to show the basis for and, I take it, the reasonableness of the report made by an immigration officer, which apparently formed the basis for the Minister's opinion. However, the affidavit was not that of the immigration officer. The notes attached to the affidavit as an exhibit indicate some commentary of the officer who made the report, and indicate some of the considerations taken into account.

Since arriving in Canada, the applicant has accumulated a criminal record that includes convictions for theft, failure to comply with a recognizance, and trafficking in a narcotic. His two convictions for trafficking resulted in concurrent sentences of two and one-half years. His criminal activity was apparently related to his heroin addiction. The deportation order issued against the applicant followed shortly after the applicant was released from incarceration for the trafficking offences.

At issue in the applicant's judicial review application is the Minister's opinion, issued pursuant to s. 70(5) of the\nAct\n, and not the deportation order.

A letter from St. Leonard's Centre provided in part:\n\"...

Throughout this period he was cooperative and pro social in interaction with staff and fellow clients.\"\nThe applicant had had no further negative contact with law enforcement officials since his release in September 1994. He maintained regular contact with his parole officer. A favourable letter from the parole officer was enclosed, which verified that the applicant had remained drug-free and cooperative.

The applicant had a full-time job; a letter from his employer stated in part:\n\"... He is a very respectable and presentable employee.

Also, counsel for the applicant noted that the applicant had converted from Islam to Christianity since coming to Canada, which would also be severely punished in Iran. Finally, the applicant had been convicted of narcotics offences in Canada, and counsel submitted on his behalf that the Iranian regime treats persons involved with narcotics with extreme sanctions including death, notwithstanding that they have been convicted and punished in accordance with the law of another state.

As well, unlike the danger opinion process where ministry officials submit reports to the decision maker, the PCDO does not obtain reports from third parties adverse in interest to the applicant. He remarked that in the PRDCC context applicants are informed at the outset what documents will be relied upon in the decision-making process. He also noted the fundamental difference between the PDRCC and danger opinion contexts in that a PDRCC decision does not necessarily facilitate the removal of an applicant.

Although there was some confusion about the exact date the Burton Report became available to the public, it is clear that it was made available after the date the applicant's refugee claim was rejected and before the dates the applicant filed her application and submissions for consideration as a member of the PDRCC class.", "032": "[32]\nThe applicant argues, however, that since\nMancia\npredates the Supreme Court of Canada decision in\nBaker\n, which expanded the duty of fairness, it is no longer good law.

In\nHaghighi\n, the Federal Court of Appeal considered the decision of an immigration officer on a humanitarian and compassionate (\"H & C\") application. In assessing the application, the immigration officer relied on a risk assessment opinion prepared by a PCDO at the request of the immigration officer. The risk assessment in\nHaghighi\nwas not the decision under review. The issue was whether the report prepared by the third party, the PCDO, should have been disclosed to the applicant for comment before the immigration officer made a final determination on the H & C application. The Court held that the duty of fairness requires that the applicant be provided with an opportunity to fully and fairly present his case. The Minister had breached this duty because the applicant had not been afforded an opportunity to respond to the PCDO's report before the final H & C determination was made.", "039": "[39]\nTherefore, while the applicant framed her argument in the language of disclosure, her complaints with respect to the reliability of the documents and the inconsistencies among them are related to the degree of weight accorded to them by the PCDO, not to their disclosure.", "006": "[6]\nWith respect to the issue of the applicant's illegal exit from China, the PCDO found that there was insufficient persuasive evidence that she would face punishment upon her return. Here the PCDO relied heavily on the Burton Report. The PCDO also noted that although the applicant argued that the extensive media coverage of the \"boat people\" arriving on Canadian shores caused great embarrassment to the Chinese government, she found that the policies and punishments that exist \"on the books\" are generally not implemented.", "043": "[43]\nI cannot find, in these circumstances, that the applicant was denied a full and fair opportunity to present her case.

In this case, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Gibson's ruling that because of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, the duty of fairness now includes the disclosure of a risk assessment report by a PCDO so that an applicant may attempt to correct errors or to point out omissions in the report, even when the report or risk assessment was based on material supplied by the applicant as part of his PDRCC application and other publicly available information that was reasonably available to the applicant.\"", "034": "[34]\nIn my view, both of these \"rules\" share a single underlying rationale. Fairness requires that documents, reports, or opinions of which the applicant is not aware, nor deemed to be aware, must be disclosed.", "009": "[9]\nThe applicant raises the following issues:\n1) Did the PCDO breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose to the applicant her risk analysis prior to reaching her decision?\n2) Did the PCDO breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose to the applicant the documents relied on in her risk analysis, thereby depriving the applicant of the opportunity to respond to the materials in question prior to reaching her decision? and,\n3) Did the PCDO fetter her discretion in by relying on the CRDD's assessment of the applicant's credibility instead of making her own independent determination?\nThe third issue was not pursued in oral argument, therefore, I will focus exclusively on the first two issues raised.\nAnalysis\nIssue # 1\nDid the PCDO breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose to the applicant her risk analysis prior to the PCDO reaching her decision?", "012": "[12]\nSubsequently, McKeown, J., faced the same issue in\nMia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 728; [2001] F.C.J. 1854 (T.D.). McKeown, J., however, was of the opinion that the duty of fairness does not require disclosure of the risk assessment by the PCDO. He addressed the holding in\nSoto\n, supra, as follows at paragraph 11:\n\"With respect, I disagree that the principles of fairness require a PCDO conducting a risk assessment to determine if the applicant is a member of the PDRCC class to disclose the risk assessment prior to making his decision. In my view, this would be tantamount to a decision-maker being required to provide its reasons for the decision for comment prior to making the final decision. This is a case where the person who reviewed the evidence made the decision. No one else was involved. This is not a case where the decision maker is receiving input from other persons than the applicant. Further, I note that\nHaghighi\ndealt with an application under humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thus there was no reviewable error on this issue.\"", "028": "[28]\nI do not accept this argument. First, as argued by the respondent, the decision in\nChu\nis limited on its facts to the danger opinion process. Second, Rothstein, J.A., referred to the Federal Court, Trial Division, decision in\nNadarajah\nand not to the subsequent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the same case. In the Trial Division reasons in\nNadarajah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1996] F.C.J. No. 649; 112 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.), the Court framed the issue as follows:\n\"The issue in this judicial review is whether information on country conditions that was not in the applicants' immigration files, but is considered in a PDRCC risk assessment, constitutes extrinsic evidence requiring the Post-claim Determination Officer to inform the applicants that such information would be considered, and provide them with an opportunity to respond.\"", "030": "[30]\nIn\nBhagwandass\n, a danger opinion case, Sharlow, J.A., applied the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal in\nHaghighi\nstating at paragraph 22:\n\"Haghighi also establishes that, in considering whether the duty of fairness requires advance disclosure of an internal Ministry report on which a decision maker will rely in making a discretionary decision, the question is not whether the report is or contains extrinsic evidence of facts unknown to the person affected by the decision, but whether the disclosure of the report is required to provide that person with a reasonable opportunity to participate in a meaningful manner in the decision-making process ...\"", "036": "[36]\nTherefore, while it is clear that the distinction between extrinsic and non-extrinsic evidence is no longer determinative of whether the duty of fairness requires disclosure, the rationale behind the rule in\nMancia\nremains. I arrive at this conclusion because even in recent jurisprudence, applying the post-\nBaker\nframework for defining the duty of fairness, the overriding concern with respect to disclosure is whether the document, opinion, or report is one of which the individual is aware or deemed to be aware.", "004": "[4]\nThe PCDO found that the applicant is not a member of the PDRCC class as defined in section 2(1) of the\nImmigration Regulations\n, SOR/78-172, because the applicant would not be subjected to serious risk to her life, extreme sanctions or inhumane treatment if she were returned to China.

The Board appears to accept Mrs. Ghasemian's explanation that she was at all times under the strict control of her former husband until her family persuaded him to let her visit them in Canada in September 1998.

Where competing interests are at play, an \"all-or-nothing approach\" is simply not appropriate. In this vein, I find the Supreme Court of Canada's comments in\nA.M. v. Ryan\n, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157; 207 N.R. 81; 85 B.C.A.C. 81; 138 W.A.C. 81 at paras. 33-34 instructive:\n\"It follows that if the court considering a claim for privilege determines that a particular document or class of documents must be produced to get at the truth and prevent an unjust verdict, it must permit production to the extent required to avoid that result. On the other hand, the need to get at the truth and avoid injustice does not automatically negate the possibility of protection from full disclosure. In some cases, the court may well decide that the truth permits of nothing less than full production. This said, I would venture to say that an order for partial privilege will more often be appropriate in civil cases where, as here, the privacy interest is compelling. Disclosure of a limited number of documents, editing by the court to remove non-essential material, and the imposition of conditions on who may see and copy the documents are techniques which may be used to ensure the highest degree of confidentiality and the least damage to the protected relationship, while guarding against the injustice of cloaking the truth.\n\"In taking this approach, I respectfully decline to follow the all-or-nothing approach adopted by the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States of endorsing an absolute privilege for all psychotherapeutic records in\nJaffee v. Redmond\n, supra. The Court of Appeals in the judgment there appealed from, 51 F.3d 1346 (1995), had held that the privilege could be denied if 'in the interests of justice, the evidentiary need for the disclosure of the contents of a patient's counseling sessions outweighs that patient's privacy interests' (p. 1357). The majority in the Supreme Court, per Stevens J., rejected that approach, stating that to make confidentiality depend upon a trial judge's later evaluation of the relative importance of the patient's interest in privacy and the evidentiary need for disclosure would be 'little better than no privilege at all' (p. 1932).\"", "041": "[41]\nInstead, a summons must be \"sufficiently specific\" such that the witness is able to know what is needed before appearing to testify - a summons cannot amount to a fishing expedition or a \"demand to make a discovery of documents\" (see\nDalgleish v.

Thus, although the\nPrivacy Act\nallows for disclosure of personal information pursuant to an order issued by a Court or other body such as the RPD (see paragraph 8(2)(c)), this exemption should not be liberally construed.

However, this argument is misplaced. The visa officer is not required to provide a piecemeal ongoing determination and advise the applicant at each stage, even if a personal interview is conducted. The units of assessment award is the conventional way in which visa officers determine whether an immigrant visa may be issued. Section 11(3) is exceptional. Where an applicant has reason to believe that he or she may be established in Canada, irrespective of the units of assessment determination, he or she should apply for a determination under s. 11(3) setting forth relevant reasons.

In the Progress Summary, there are two references to the fact that the applicant was being investigated for further alleged sexual offences.

As a result, the psychiatrist, who was the Chairman of the Division of Forensic and Correctional Psychiatry at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, made his assessment based on the file material and a brief conversation which he had with the case management officer of the applicant. The psychiatrist noted in his report that the sexual assault which led to the conviction and incarceration of the applicant implied \"... premeditation and planning and a previous similar act or at least fantasy rehearsal of such an act\". Furthermore, he observed that the attendance of the applicant at a sex offender program during his day parole in Hamilton had resulted in \"... unsatisfactory therapeutic progress and the therapist expressed little surprise that he was charged with further sexual offences\". Although the psychiatrist expressed reluctance to make a diagnosis in the absence of a personal interview with the applicant, he interpreted the reports of the Hamilton therapist as suggesting the possibility of psychopathy. He concluded that\n\"the overall picture presented from the file information, especially that obtained more recently and which is considered sensitive, is of an individual with well concealed sexual pathology that would make him a high risk to reoffend sexually ... At the present time, for lack of more detailed information and the fact that he now faces charges and is under continuing police investigation, it is difficult to make a satisfactory assessment of his risk. However, given all the available information, I think it very likely that Mr. Giroux could commit further aggressive sexual offences were he to be released at his statutory released (sic) date.\"", "020": "[20]\nThe constitutional rights enshrined in s. 11 of the\nCharter\nare procedural safeguards designed to afford protection to an accused person in the context of the prosecution of \"... public offences involving punitive sanctions, i.e. criminal, quasi-criminal and regulatory offences ...\".

However, the applicant was not in jeopardy on these charges in the detention review before the Board and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be said to have been subject to prosecution in that forum. The detention review proceedings were administrative in nature and, in conducting the review, the Board was required by s. 132(1) of the\nAct\nto consider any factor relevant to a determination of \"... the likelihood of the commission of an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person ...\". Furthermore, under s. 101 of the\nAct\n, the protection of society was the paramount consideration guiding the Board in the discharge of its functions. In my opinion, the existence of criminal charges for sexual offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant was a highly relevant factor to be considered by the Board, regardless of the date of the alleged incident. This evidence was of particular importance in the circumstances of this case, given the reluctance of the applicant to accept any blame for the offence which led to his incarceration, his denial of aberrant sexual conduct and his lack of therapeutic progress. Although the applicant has a constitutionally protected right to be presumed innocent in the context of his prosecution on the outstanding criminal charges, he had no such corresponding right in the administrative proceedings before the Board. In my opinion, it would have been inconsistent with the law and the public interest in ensuring the effective protection of society for the Board have presumed him to be innocent on those charges.\nDecision", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant seeks judicial review of a decision dated February 4, 1994 of the National Parole Board (\"the Board\") ordering him detained in custody until the expiration of his sentence or until otherwise directed.", "011": "[11]\nThe facts of this case establish that the psychiatric assessment in which the applicant had refused to participate was not disclosed to him at least 15 days before his detention review in compliance with s. 141(1) of the\nAct\n.

The courts have previously found that compensation in unjust dismissal cases can be assessed as lost wages during a reasonable notice period. This has become an accepted practice which is responsive to the exact situation. For example, if the employee finds employment of greater value after a (sic) unjust dismissal, that employee should be compensated for the damages of the dismissal, however the\nAct\nis not intended to grant that employee a windfall profit.\"\nWith this general proposition I agree. The\nCode\ndoes not require that the adjudicator award a complainant her full salary as compensation. The complainant must mitigate her losses and the adjudicator must consider factors which might affect the appropriate quantum of the award.

They did however find, at p. 70, that the letter of October 6 created a reasonable apprehension of bias because:\n\"[i]t contained a serious assertion questioning the very truthfulness of the applicant's claim that the position formerly held by the respondent had been abolished. It also asserted facts that simply were not properly placed before the adjudicator, who had yet to decide whether to grant the requested remedy of reinstatement.\"", "045": "[45]\nIn oral and written submissions counsel for the applicant stated that the appropriate measure of damages in these cases was assessed according to the notice period required to be given by an employer under the common law. However, research indicated that limiting an award on the basis of the common law or s. 235 of the\nCode\nwas an error. I revealed the fruits of this research to counsel for the applicant in a memorandum and asked for his written submissions. When I received these submissions from counsel it appeared that he felt aggrieved by not being heard orally and I therefore instructed an oral hearing to be held with respect to the issue of the quantum of damages awarded by the adjudicator by way of teleconference. Counsel for both parties participated in this hearing.", "042": "[42]\nThe situation before me is distinct in that Me Par\u00e9, counsel for the respondent, referred to the quantum as insufficient and not covering legal expenses.

If the failure to raise the issue results from no fault of the individual adversely affected, for example it is not a tactical manoeuvre, the issue may be raised on an appeal or, as in this case, on an application for judicial review. This case is not analogous to that facing Lord Goddard in\nR. v. Nailsworth Licensing Justices, ex parte Bird\n, [1953] 1 W.L.R. 1046 (D.C.), wherein he stated at p. 1048:\n\"The solicitor did not take his objection then and it seems clear that he decided to let the matter go on, taking the view that this was a heaven-sent opportunity of getting the order quashed if the committee found in favour of the application.

Furthermore, even if the adjudicator had purported to retain jurisdiction with respect to the merits of the case, he could not have done so. An adjudicator cannot confer powers on him or herself. The authority and powers of an adjudicator stem only from the governing statute. In\nChandler v.

It can only do so if there has been a slip or error within the exceptions enunciated in\nPaper Machinery Ltd. v. J.O. Ross Engineering Corp.\n, supra.\n\"To this extent, the principle of \"functus officio\" applies. It is based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal ... Justice may require the reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would otherwise be available on appeal.\n\"Accordingly, the principle should not be strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling statute that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation. This was the situation in\nGrillas\n, supra.\n\"Furthermore, if the tribunal has failed to dispose of an issue which is fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose, it ought to be allowed to complete its statutory task.\"\nFurthermore, in\nHuneault v.

Moreover, the purported reservation by him of authority to make such orders, if any, as might be appropriate and necessary after receipt of submissions on the question of the Unemployment Insurance benefit refunds cannot affect our conclusion.\"", "029": "[29]\nAlthough an adjudicator retains jurisdiction to finally dispose of a matter by rendering an order pursuant to s. 242(4), the adjudicator is not thereby empowered to rehear the merits of a case.

No one was available to scrutinize the evidence of the employer and therefore, Mr. Brault was the first person who could have advised Chief St. Denis that putting the letter into evidence might have both positive and negative consequences. This type of situation is the result of the more informal proceedings under the\nCode\n. However, informal procedures cannot be an excuse for allowing the adjudicator to appear biased.

The allegation of prejudice should not be secretly harboured, but made public immediately, thereby hoping to catch the tribunal 'red handed', so to speak, in its prejudice and misconduct. So it is that the posture of waiting to discover whether one wins the contention before the adjudicator, prepared to make no allegation of prejudice if one does win, and complaining of alleged prejudice as a means of trying to avoid a confirmed loss, is abusive and to be discouraged.\"", "015": "[15]\nWith respect to the Band's financial situation, the record reveals a \"Combined Statement of Income and Expenses\" for the Band Operations Fund from year end of March 1990 to year end of March 1992. [see footnote 2] The applicant's position is that one-half of the respondent's salary was paid from fund 4210 which showed a deficit for year end 1992. However, the date of the latest financial records was almost two full years before the respondent was dismissed. There are no records for the budget from which the balance of the respondent's salary was paid; a budget which the adjudicator found was not transferable nor related to the government account for which records were submitted. Additionally, as the adjudicator stated at p. 7:\n\"... no convincing evidence was adduced to establish the precise circumstances of the decision to abolish Ms. Young's position in relation to that deficit. The only evidence offered in this respect shows that the janitor's position was abolished and consolidated with that of manager. Even though the Band's initial reply to the complaint referred to Ms. Young's seniority, it did not adduce any evidence to show that seniority was ever considered.\"\nThis supports a finding of unjust dismissal as the burden of justifying the dismissal lies with the employer.\nIII.\nBias", "010": "[10]\nThe crux of the adjudicator's February 14 decision can be found at pp. 7 and 8 and reads as follows:\n\"The Band submits that the sole reason for discontinuing Ms. Young's position was the necessity to redress the Band's finances. Leaving aside for the moment the requirements of s. 209.1, I have reviewed the evidence adduced by the Band with regard to the discontinuance of Ms. Young's position. It consisted in part of excerpts of its financial statements that show an accumulated deficit in the band's government activities account. This being said, no convincing evidence was adduced to establish the precise circumstances of the decision to abolish Ms. Young's position in relation to that deficit. The only evidence offered in this respect shows that the janitor's position was abolished and consolidated with that of manager. Even though the Band's initial reply to the complaint referred to Ms. Young's seniority, it did not adduce any evidence to show that seniority was ever considered.\n\"Further, no indication was given as to the impact of Ms. Young's position on the Band's government costs nor was any evidence adduced on the actual impact of such decision on the Band's financial situation. The Band's own evidence, as I understand it, was that Ms. Young's position was funded through a budget that was not transferable, a budget not even related to the Band's government account. How was it, in those circumstances, that abolishing her position would improve the Band's deficit with respect to its band government account?\n\"Finally and more importantly, in the months that followed her departure, the Band created and posted a position identical to that held by Ms. Young. It was suggested that since the new position was funded by the LAMBAT, it created a new situation. My finding is that it did not. This is evidenced by the fact that the LAMBAT itself cancelled its commitment of the so-called new position when it learned about Ms. Young's instant complaint. All these facts suggest that the so-called new position was simply intended to replace Ms. Young by someone else and that the alleged difficult financial situation of the Band was not the cause of the abolition of the position in the first place.\n\"Overall, the evidence adduced before me tends to show that Ms. Young's position was abolished for reasons unrelated to the Band's finances. It is likely that her relationship with a band councillor who was not in good terms with others on the Council played a role in the decision. Maybe did (sic) the fact that she is not a Band member also played in the decision. Finally, her absence on maternity leave opened the way to an unfair treatment contrary to the\nAct\n. This being so, I do not find that Ms. Young was laid off due to a lack of work following the discontinuance of her function.\"", "063": "[63]\nWith respect to the award for legal costs, the decision at p. 28 reads:\n\"The issue has been canvassed at length in numerous decisions, mainly in\nBanca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. v. Lee-Shanok\n(1988), 22 C.C.E.L. 59 (F.C.A.), where the Federal Court of Appeal expressed some reservation about awarding costs other than party-and-party costs. The issue was also reviewed in\nCote v. Dicom Corporation\n, Feb. 1987 (Sabouring), filed by counsel for the employer.\n\"The complainant is in a dire financial situation and there is no doubt that it is equitable under s. 242(4)(c) to [award her] reasonable compensation for her legal costs.\n\"This case lasted two days and even though the overall costs she claims may not appear unreasonable per se, I would allow a lump sum of $2,500 towards the complainant's legal fees. This amount is to cover the attendance as well as her counsel's preparation.\n\"Further, expenses amounting to $433.64 were charged to the complainant by her counsel and she is entitled to be paid back of these expenses. This comes to a total sum of $2,733.64 for legal costs to which she is entitled.\"\nThe essence of this award seems to be that, considering the respondent's dire financial circumstances, an award of costs would be equitable in order to remedy the damage caused by her former employer. The adjudicator cited\nBanca\n, supra in support of this award. The relevant excerpt from the decision of Stone, J.A., in\nBanca\nis found at p. 77 [C.C.E.L.]:\n\"I have no difficulty in reading it [paragraph 242(4)(c)], with its broad reference to granting relief that is 'equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal,' as including the power to award costs. The difficulty I have is in viewing an award of compensation, gained at some considerable expense to a complainant in terms of legal costs, as having the effect of making him whole. Legal costs incurred would effectively reduce compensation for lost remuneration, while their allowance would appear to remedy or, at least, to counteract a consequence of the dismissal. I am not persuaded by the applicant's contention that para. (c) does not permit an award of costs because the only pecuniary award contemplated by Parliament is compensation as provided for in para. (a).\"", "065": "[65]\nIn awarding interest the adjudicator wrote at p. 29:\n\"The amounts owed for lost wages ($15,320) will bear interest as per the case law reviewed in\nCote v. Dicom Corporation\nand\nBanca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. v. Lee-Shanok\n. I set the rate at an annual rate of 3% which appears reasonable in the present circumstances, the current bank rate being set at around 4%. I further determine that the interests owed on this amount will run as of January 3, 1994, the date at which she would have returned to work.\n\"As for the other amounts owed ($2,733.64 + $485.84 = $3,217.48), they also will bear interest at the same annual rate of 3% but as of the date of our last hearing, i.e. June 14, 1995.\"", "008": "[8]\nCommon sense dictates that the adjudicator is not required to simply accept the employer's statement that the employee was laid off for the reasons described in s. 242(3.1)(a). If that was indeed the effect of that paragraph then the adjudicator's role would effectively be eliminated because any employer faced with an adjudication under s. 242 of the\nCode\nwould simply have to give the above explanation, and since no examination could then be done, the issue would be closed. In this respect, the adjudicator's decision quoted infra addresses the jurisdiction issue. On the basis of the record, I find that the adjudicator was correct in finding that the employer's allegation of discontinuance of a function was not supported. As a consequence, the adjudicator properly had jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits of Ms. Young's claim.", "061": "[61]\nIn the instant case the adjudicator ordered that eight months salary be paid to the respondent as compensation.

The role of the adjudicator in the conduct of a hearing is to act more or less 'in the role of a judge and not venture into the fray as prosecutor or defence' (\nCanadian Labour Law\n(2nd Ed.), G.W. Adams, Canada Law Book, par 4.730). This is precisely what happened here, and failing compelling evidence showing that a party was not aware of its acts, I fail to see how it could be otherwise.\"\nI agree with his assessment of this situation.

If the adjudicator determines that the employee was let go for one of these two valid reasons then the adjudicator will not proceed further. However, when an adjudicator determines that the explanation offered by the employer is not valid, the adjudicator has the jurisdiction to do a full enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal.", "012": "[12]\nFor the sake of thoroughness, as both counsel dealt with the merits of the points raised by the applicant with respect to the interim award in this application, I will make a few brief remarks.\nII.\nBurden of Proof", "059": "[59]\nFinally, in\nEnnis v.

In support of this contention counsel looks to the language of the adjudicator at p. 27 of the supplementary award:\n\"Ms. Young was dismissed at the very moment she would have returned to work following a maternity leave. She had formally received assurances that she would get her job back, and was never forewarned of her incoming dismissal. Moreover, the Band unsuccessfully tried to replace her under the guise of a newly-created position which they tried to fill with someone else.\"\nI cannot agree with counsel's submission that, without more, this should be interpreted as meaning that the damage award was punitive in nature. Immediately preceding this passage, the adjudicator canvassed many other cases and recited the fact patterns for each case. In my view, this passage merely recaps the facts of this case. The award is not unreasonable and can be objectively justified. The adjudicator did not compensate Ms. Young for the entire period of unemployment between the date of her dismissal and the date of the award although the\nCode\ndoes allow for that. Thus, I cannot say that the quantum awarded was calculated based on punitive principles.", "051": "[51]\nSection 242(4) of the\nCode\nis clear in its application; it is designed to fully compensate an employee who is unjustly dismissed. It is not limited to the amount of severance pay to which the employee is entitled. It is not calculated by determining the notice period which should have been given to the employee. In\nDavidson v. Slaight Communications Inc.\n, [1985] 1 F.C. 253; 58 N.R. 150 (F.C.A.), affd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; 93 N.R. 183, Mahoney, J.A., stated at p. 260:\n\"The intent of s. 61.5(9) (now 242(4)) is to empower the adjudicator, as near as may be, to put the wronged employee in the position of not suffering an employment related disadvantage as a result of his unjustified dismissal.\"\nAlthough the section places a ceiling on the amount of damages that may be awarded, the amount is not linked to the amount of severance pay awarded to the employee. Limiting the amount of damages for unjust dismissal to the amount of severance pay or on the basis of the common law is clearly an error. Support for this proposition is found in\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Boisvert\n, [1986] 2 F.C. 431; 68 N.R. 355 (F.C.A.), where Marceau, J.A., stated at p. 439:\n\"It is commonplace that the introduction of the remedy pursuant to s. 61.5 of the\nCode\nin 1978 was a very major step in the transformation undergone by labour law applicable to federal undertakings since [at] the time it was still founded on purely liberal concepts based on the theory of freedom of contract. Certainly the employer's right to terminate the contract of an employee was already far from being unfettered (prior notice, severance pay) and the common law courts no longer hesitated to apply the theory of abuse of right to penalize the excessive use of the right of dismissal by an employer. However, once the s. 61.5 remedy was in place it was no longer possible, as it had been formerly, to treat the right of dismissal as being of the very essence of an indefinite contract of employment; it also was no longer possible to speak of freedom of contract in this connection, as the new legislation was said to be a matter of public policy and as such unaffected by the language of the contract of employment.\"", "036": "[36]\nThe applicant raises two issues with respect to the substance of the supplementary award. First, the applicant alleges bias in that counsel for the respondent improperly revealed facts to the adjudicator in a letter dated March 14, 1995.

The applicant states that Labour Canada is the adjudicator's employer. Therefore, its opinion should not have been admitted into evidence as it makes it appear that the adjudicator's decision was not his own but was influenced by the opinion in the letter.

This new evidence, in my view, does not much more than confirm what was found and considered by the Registrar himself, namely that the respondent \"often employs its trademark HUGO BOSS in conjunction with and subsidiary to its trademark BOSS\". Moreover, this new evidence does certainly not discredit the inference drawn by the Registrar that the appellant's wares \"might well be identified by a salesman as being HUGO suits ...\".", "014": "[14]\nIn the final analysis, the Registrar concluded that he was left in doubt as to \"whether there might be a likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue\".

Accordingly, no evidence concerning the use of the trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design can be considered given the appellant did not commence using such mark until after filing its application for proposed use.", "017": "[17]\nIn the case at bar, I find that the Registrar applied the correct test to determine whether there was any likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue based on the evidence which was before him. The Registrar correctly applied the likelihood of confusion test set out in s. 6(5) of the\nAct\n, considered all the surrounding circumstances including those specified in each paragraph of the latter provision, and properly did so from the point of view of the average consumer as a matter of an immediate impression and imperfect recollection.

He also held that there had been fairly extensive use of the trademark HUGO BOSS in Canada in association with men's clothing and that the trademark HUGO BOSS had become known to some extent in Canada as of the material date (the appellant's application date). In contrast, the appellant's trademark had not become known at all in Canada as of the filing date given that it did not commence using its trademark until after filing its proposed use application.", "008": "[8]\nIt is undisputed that the ground of prior entitlement based on s. 16(3) of the\nAct\nneeded to be decided on the issue of confusion between the trademarks VICTOR HUGO & Design and HUGO BOSS.

In accordance with the clear wording of section 16(3) of the\nAct\n, the material time for considering the circumstances respecting this issue is as of the applicant's filing date. Furthermore, the onus or legal burden is on the applicant to establish that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue.

In fact, I am of the view that the issue of actual confusion could not be relevant to the Registrar's determination of the opposition ground of prior entitlement based on s. 16(3) of the\nAct\nbecause at the material date, which is the filing date of the appellant's application, there could not have been any instances of actual confusion involving the appellant's trademark at issue given it had not then yet been used. However, the following inferences drawn by the Registrar with respect to \"the potential nature of the trade relating to the purchase of suits\" could well constitute relevant surrounding circumstances within the meaning of s. 6(5) of the\nAct\n:\n\"The events relating to the instances of actual confusion do indicate the potential nature of the trade relating to the purchase of suits in that Mr. Korman would remove suits from the rack for his customers to try on, such that the customer may not necessarily notice or otherwise carefully check the labels on the suit prior to its purchase. That being the case, the applicant's wares might well be identified by a salesman as being HUGO suits, as opposed to VICTOR HUGO suits, which could result in a consumer being confused and particularly so when he is in a retail establishment which is also selling HUGO BOSS suits.\"", "006": "[6]\nOn the basis of the evidence before him, the Registrar considered the respondent's ground of opposition that the appellant was not the person entitled to registration pursuant to s. 16(3) [see footnote 2] of the\nAct\n, which was decided on the issue of confusion between the trademarks VICTOR HUGO & Design and HUGO BOSS.

The Registrar held that the wares of the parties are the same and the channels of trade associated with their wares would overlap. He noted that their wares have been sold through the same men's retail clothing stores in Canada.", "009": "[9]\nIn fact, the Registrar assessed the likelihood of confusion based on all the surrounding circumstances including those specifically set forth in s. 6(5) of the\nAct\n.", "012": "[12]\nWith respect to the degree of resemblance between the marks at issue in appearance, sound and ideas suggested by them, as set out in s. 6(5)(e) of the\nAct\n, the Registrar noted that both marks suggest the idea of the name of a person including the word HUGO which is a given name in the respondent's trademark HUGO BOSS and a Christian name in the appellant's trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design. The Registrar concluded that the appellant's trademark is dominated visually by the word HUGO. Also, the element BOSS in the respondent's trademark would be perceived visually by the average consumer as being the dominant element of the respondent's trademark given that the trademark HUGO BOSS is often used in conjunction with and subsidiary to the mark BOSS. As a result, the Registrar found there is at least some similarity in appearance between the trademarks at issue when considered as a matter of immediate impression and imperfect recollection. He further found that both marks have little resemblance when sounded.", "004": "[4]\nBefore the Registrar, the respondent's evidence consisted of the affidavit of Mr. Konrad Jud, a member of the Board of Directors of the respondent, as well as the affidavits of Messrs.

I agree with the respondent that the inadmissibility report and the case highlights are more in the nature of pro forma documents, whose essential purpose is to list relevant information from the file (revolving around the criminal conviction and related objective facts) and to provide a brief rationale for the Officer\u2019s actions and recommendation. They are clearly distinguishable from case review recommendations in the context of public danger opinion and internal risk opinions, which are more akin to advocacy tools.\n\u2026\n[37]\u00a0 \u2026Yet, as previously noted, the decisions to make a report and to refer it to the ID are administrative in nature, and do not translate to any change in status for the appellant. Only the ID can make a removal order in this case, and the appellant has a number of other recourses available to him before actually being removed from the country (applications for judicial review of the report, of the referral and of the ID decisions, a pre-removal risk assessment, and an H&C application)\u2026", "024": "[24]\nFor the reasons stated above, I am satisfied that the decisions to refer these cases to the ID were reasonable and made in conformity with the discretion conferred by s\u00a044 of the IRPA.\u00a0 These applications are, accordingly, dismissed.", "019": "[19]\nClearly the Court was not sympathetic to the kind of arguments made by the Applicants\u2019 in these proceedings that the s\u00a044 referral process includes an obligation to sort out complex matters of evidence and credibility or to assess issues of law beyond forming a bare opinion as to whether a person is inadmissible.", "022": "[22]\nThe Applicants\u2019 counsel argued that the ID is unlikely to extend relief because its authority does not include the resolution of the issues he raised with the Officer and the Delegate.\u00a0 That argument, however, unduly limits the ID\u2019s jurisdiction.\u00a0 For instance, if it can be proven that the minor dependants, Si Yi Yin and Si Man Yin, were not in control of their applications and had no knowledge of what was taking place, a misrepresentation finding arguably could not be made again them:\u00a0 see Sidhu v Canada, 2019 FCA 169 at para\u00a071.\u00a0 Similarly, if an Applicant can establish that he or she took all available precautions to protect against the perpetration of a fraud, an inadmissibility finding may not be open.\u00a0 The Applicants\u2019 further statutory interpretation argument \u2013 complex though it may be \u2013 can also be put to the ID for consideration.\u00a0 If what took place does not constitute a misrepresentation under s\u00a040, it would obviously fall within the ID\u2019s authority to decide.\u00a0 It is also open to argument that the ID can consider an abuse of process argument based on an assertion that, in at least two of these cases, the CBSA was unfairly attempting to split its admissibility case into two parts (ie. residency followed by misrepresentation).\u00a0 The only avenue that may not be available to the Applicants before the ID is recourse to the humanitarian and compassionate relief, but that would be available before the IAD.", "023": "[23]\nI will make a further observation about the Applicants\u2019 approach to the s 44 process.\u00a0 Not one of the Applicants provided sworn evidence about their awareness of what Mr.\u00a0Wang was doing on their behalf.\u00a0 The only \u201cevidence\u201d of a lack of complicity provided to the Officer came from the Applicants\u2019 counsel\u2019s uncorroborated representations.\u00a0 It seems implausible that Mr.\u00a0Wang\u2019s involvement would have been required to simply renew the Applicants\u2019 permanent residency cards.\u00a0 Although such a renewal may not be conditional on meeting the minimum residency requirement, a truthful representation of time spent in Canada could have triggered a residency enquiry with a resulting loss of status.\u00a0 This concern was more likely to have been behind the retainer of Mr. Wang by the Applicants than the bare renewal of their residency cards.\u00a0 But, in any event, it was not unreasonable for the Delegate to refer these complex evidentiary and legal arguments to the ID.\u00a0 Furthermore, whatever the scope of the discretion, in the absence of sworn corroboration counsel\u2019s attestations of the Applicants\u2019 innocence were deserving of little, if any, weight.", "014": "[14]\nIt must first be said that the above arguments advanced by the Applicants involve complex issues of law and evidence that could never be adequately addressed in the context of the process contemplated by ss 44(1) and 44(2).\u00a0 While a practice has developed to invite persons subject to these provisions to make humanitarian and compassionate submissions and sometimes to attend for an interview, there is no method under these provisions by which disputed evidence can be effectively challenged or weighed by the Officer or by the Delegate.", "005": "[5]\nThe Applicants maintain that they are all innocent and unknowing victims of Mr.\u00a0Wang and that, in referring their cases to an admissibility hearing before the ID, the decision-makers failed to consider their asserted lack of individual complicity.\u00a0 On this issue the common argument they advance is the following:\n21. \u00a0 The Respondent\u2019s counsel appears to be advancing the same belief of the Minister\u2019s Delegate in charge of admissibility referrals, that as a group these clients of the fraudulent consultant are all complicit without the need to see evidence of their individual complicity.\n22. \u00a0 The Respondent presented no evidence of complicity by these Applicants.\u00a0 The only evidence that the Respondent has is incorrectly stated days of absences from Canada.\u00a0 While that may be sufficient to allege misrepresentation under the Respondent\u2019s current understanding of the law, each case will still have to be assessed individually to see (1) if the under-reporting of absences constitutes misrepresentation under 40(1)(a) of IRPA; (2) the materiality and seriousness of the misrepresentation which requires an examination of the evidence with respect to complicity; (3) given the level of seriousness found, what corresponding level of humanitarian and compassionate grounds is required to overcome such seriousness so that the discretion not to refer may be exercised.\n[Paras 21 and 22

the IAD where a full humanitarian and compassionate review may take place.", "017": "[17]\nAlthough the Court in Cha, above, was careful to limit the application of its reasons to cases involving foreign nationals I cannot identify a rational basis to extend a more generous substantive discretion to permanent residents under s 44.\u00a0 I accept that greater due process requirements may apply to permanent residents because they are at risk of losing their residency status.\u00a0 However, unlike some provisions in the IRPA that grant heightened substantive rights to permanent residents, s 44 treats foreign nationals and permanent residents alike.\u00a0 Accordingly, whatever the basis of inadmissibility may be, the discretion not to make a referral to the ID is the same for both classes.", "015": "[15]\nThe idea that the Officer or the Delegate has the ability, let alone the responsibility, to assess the level of individual culpability of the Applicants is, in practical and legal terms, untenable.\u00a0 The same can be said for the argument that, in forming the necessary opinions, the Officer and the Delegate should have considered whether false statements made in the context of the applications to renew permanent residency cards could ever constitute misrepresentations upon which inadmissibility findings could be made and whether, in two of the cases, an abuse of process had occurred.\u00a0 The obvious place to advance such matters is before the ID and, where available, before the IAD where adjudicative processes are in place and where conflicting evidence can be properly tested and complex legal issues concerning admissibility can be considered. \u00a0I would add that the argument that a misrepresentation cannot legally arise from a misrepresentation made in connection with an application to obtain or renew a permanent residency card was firmly rejected by Justice\u00a0Ann\u00a0Marie\u00a0McDonald in Geng v Canada, 2017 FC 1155, 286 ACWS 3d 728.", "010": "[10]\nClearly the opinions under review are not decisions in the usual sense because, beyond the bare referral for further consideration before the ID, no determinative findings of fact or law

context bears some resemblance to the formation of a prima facie belief of the sort described in Kindler v MacDonald, [1987] 3 FC 34 (FCA) at para\u00a09, [1987] FCJ No 507, where a referral decision was said not to require even a paper hearing.\u00a0 Contrary to the Applicants\u2019 submissions the formation and expression of an opinion under s\u00a044 is not equivalent to a misrepresentation finding made in connection with an attempt to acquire status under the IRPA.\u00a0 Status is neither gained nor lost by the referral process described in ss\u00a044(1) or ss 44(2).", "008": "[8]\nIn the case of Mr. Zhou the abuse of process argument was dismissed because the misrepresentation referral was only made in 2016 following the completion of the CBSA criminal investigation into Mr. Wang, whereas the residency case dated back to 2011 [see CTR in IMM-1061-18 at p 650].", "013": "[13]\nThe Applicants contend that, in their cases, the Officer and the Delegate were required to reflect on the validity of their arguments concerning an asserted abuse of process, their respective levels of complicity in Mr. Wang\u2019s fraudulent activity and whether, on a correct interpretation of the IRPA, a misrepresentation made in support of an application to renew a permanent residency card can support an inadmissibility finding under s\u00a040.\u00a0 Among other points, the Applicants argue that, in order to properly exercise the discretion under s 44 of the IRPA not to refer their cases onward, the Officer and the Delegate must examine and resolve these complex issues before coming to their required opinions.\u00a0 This is particularly the case, they say, for assessing the humanitarian and compassionate factors that they presented, unsworn, through their counsel (including credibility assessments) about their respective levels of awareness and complicity concerning the misconduct of Mr.\u00a0Wang. \u00a0Although the Applicants appear to accept that a misrepresentation may be found in the absence of a fraudulent intent, they argue that the degree of a person\u2019s culpability is still relevant to the exercise of humanitarian and compassionate discretion: see Applicant\u2019s Memorandum in IMM-3358-18 at paras\u00a076 and 78.", "006": "[6]\nThe Applicants also complain that the referrals of their cases to an admissibility hearing were unreasonable because the responsible officials failed to resolve their legal argument that a false statement made to obtain a permanent residency card does not constitute a misrepresentation under s 40 of the IRPA.\u00a0 This somewhat convoluted statutory interpretation argument, with variations, was submitted by the Applicants\u2019 legal counsel for consideration in the s 44 referral process [see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at pp\u00a0593-599 and pp 413-420].\u00a0 However, the issue was not resolved by the referring officials on the basis that \u201cthese arguments are better to be heard by a Member of the Immigration Division\u201d [see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at p 495 and p 7; and also see CTR in IMM-3629-18 at p 6].", "020": "[20]\nFor these reasons I conclude that the scope of discretion available to the Applicants in these cases is no greater than that described in Cha, above, which is to say that aggravating and disputed mitigating circumstances are effectively off the table.\u00a0 It is open to the Officer and the Delegate to reflect on \u201cclear and non-controversial\u201d facts concerning the grounds of inadmissibility \u2013 and presumably to entertain a submission about those facts \u2013 but the

facts.\u00a0 The use of the words \u201cmay prepare a report\u201d has been held to connote some level of discretion in certain circumstances not to write a report: see Hernandez v Canada, 2005 FC 429, [2005] FCJ No 533.\u00a0 It is presumably in recognition of that discretion that a practice has arisen for the Officer to invite submissions from the person affected to make the case not to refer the matter to the Delegate.\u00a0 Indeed, the CBSA utilizes a standard form request inviting the person to address several factors including age, length of Canadian residency, location of family support and responsibilities, conditions in the home country, degree of establishment, criminal history, history of non-compliance and current attitude (see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at p\u00a0432).

summary review of the record before them on the strength of which they express non-binding opinions about potential inadmissibility. \u00a0This is no more than a screening exercise that triggers an adjudication.\u00a0 It is at the adjudicative stage where controversial issues of law and evidence can be assessed and resolved.\u00a0 As the Federal Court of Appeal held in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Cha, 2006 FCA 126 at paras\u00a047 and 48, [2007] 1 FCR 409, the referral process is intended only to assess readily and objectively ascertainable facts concerning

discretion not to make a referral to the ID, it is up to the Officer and the Delegate to determine how that will be exercised and what evidence will be applied to the task. \u00a0This point was made by Justice James Russell in Faci, above, at para 63:\n[63]\u00a0 The jurisprudence of this Court makes clear that, when deciding whether to recommend an admissibility hearing, the Minister\u2019s

By signing Mr. LIN also declares he understands all the information in the application and also understands false statements or concealment of material facts may be grounds for his prosecution or removal. The submissions alleges the misrepresentation was committed by the \u201ccrooked\u201d consultant he had hired and that he is a victim of this consultatnt [sic] and the activities he undertook. It is established in case law that misrepresentation can be committed by another person without one\u2019s knowledge as per Goudarzi v. Canada, 2012 FC 425.\nMr. LIN had successfully appealed a decision made by the Mission in Beijing regarding residency obligations. Mr. LIN had been refused a Travel Document (Permanent Resident Abroad) as the Officer came to the decision Mr. LIN did not fulfill his residency obligations. On 28 September 2015 the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) \u2013 Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) set aside the Officer\u2019s decision and found Mr.\u00a0LIN had not lost his permanent resident status. During this proceeding the issue that was dealt with may have been touched upon during the IAD appeal however the main issue was the Mission\u2019s decision to refuse to issue Mr. LIN a Travel Document from a previous application due to his alleged failure to meet residency obligations. The issue currently being dealt with is that of misrepresentation on a Permanent Resident Card Application and a Section 44 report pursuant to Section 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) had not been written previous to that appeal. Regardless of whether Mr. LIN met residency requirements or qualified under one of the options regarding residency obligations, the fact is Mr. LIN had submitted a fraudulent travel history in his Application for a Permanent Resident Card dated 28 March 2013."}, "decision": "The merits of the Delegate\u2019s decision are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness"}, "516": {"paragraphs": {"018": "[18]\nThe issue is whether the economic hardship and the emotional distress which will be experienced by the Wife and daughter constitute irreparable harm.

An action involves, once the pleadings are filed, discovery of documents, examinations for discovery, and then trials with viva voce evidence. It is obviously important that parties not be put to the delay and expense involved in taking a matter to trial if it is 'plain and obvious' (the test for striking out pleadings) that the pleading in question cannot amount to a cause of action or a defence to a cause of action. ....\n... the direct and proper way to contest an originating notice of motion which the respondent thinks to be without merit is to appear and argue at the hearing of the motion itself.

Indeed, it appears that the \"striking from the record\" did not formally occur until sometime after the decision on the merits was made (see footnote 1 on page 182).

The issues are as follows:\na. Did the Board err in determining that it was not plausible that the LTTE would demand an exorbitant sum from the Appellant, or would commit extortion on an elderly person in Colombo;\nb. Is the test at law, for an IFA, different under s. 97(1)(b) of the IRPA;\nc. Did the Board err in law or exceed jurisdiction or make errors of fact in relation to the IFA finding;\nd. Did the Board err in finding that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear;\ne. Did the Board err by failing to provide a separate analysis under ss. 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA;\nf. Did the Board err in law vis-\u00e0-vis the test under s. 97(1)(b); and\ng. Did the Board err in law vis-\u00e0-vis the test under s. 96 of the IRPA.\nARGUMENT\nCredibility", "029": "[29]\nShe says that the Board erred in assessing all the grounds for credibility, and goes on to argue that, if the Board erred in the credibility finding, the decision cannot stand, since the extortion took place in the location of the proposed IFA, Colombo. She also notes that the Board's decision cited the UNHCR passage which states that removal to Sri Lanka should only occur after each case is examined on the merits of the applicant's own circumstances.", "057": "[57]\nIn conclusion, I am of the view that the Board did not properly assess Mrs. Anthonimuthu's credibility and the plausibility of her claim, and that these findings are sufficiently central to the Board's analysis to require that the decision be set aside. No question will be certified.", "023": "[23]\nThe applicant argues that there are a number of errors in the Board's decision. The first is that the Board relied on the finding that the applicant was not credible, because she came to Canada to be with her children.", "014": "[14]\nOn the second ground, the Board finds it not plausible that the LTTE would demand such a large amount of money, even if the applicant had children living abroad. The Board claims that there is no reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large sums of money in Colombo during the period of time alleged by the claimant, nor was there evidence that elderly Tamils were mistreated by any authority. The Board finds that the applicant's allegation of extortion is not supported by the documentary evidence. The Board finds that the applicant came to Canada to be with her children.", "044": "[44]\nThe respondent closes the IFA argument by stating that, a claimant will not merit protection if the government of the country of origin is capable of providing the necessary protection within its territory and where it may reasonably be expected that, having taken all the circumstances into consideration, the person can move to that part of the territory. The respondent says the onus is on the applicant to show why the IFA is unreasonable, and submits that the applicant, in this case, has failed to do so.\nANALYSIS", "005": "[5]\nIn 1995, the army attacked Jaffna, where the applicant was living. The applicant and her family were displaced to St. Thomas Church at Point Pedro, where there was a shortage of food and medicine. The applicant's husband became very ill.", "026": "[26]\nThe applicant goes on to argue that the finding that the extortion was not plausible was also erroneous. The applicant says that the Board's ground for finding that the extortion did not take place was that the amount was too high. She says that the Board erred because there was no evidence of the quantum of money that the LTTE extorts from people in Sri Lanka. She testified that the LTTE knew she had four children abroad, and she submits that approximately CDN$ 16,000 is not an 'exorbitant' amount of money among four Children living in Canada.", "055": "[55]\nIn its decision, the Board focused on the fact that the Applicant was previously raised in Colombo, was educated in English (which is still the language of commerce), could receive medical care, would be able to worship in her choice of religious facility, and receives a government pension. But all of this would be of little comfort if she is really at risk of being the victim of extortion at the hands of the LTTE. It must be remembered that the Applicant is an elderly woman of 76, with no relatives in Colombo to protect her.", "021": "[21]\nThe Board's final issue is consolidated grounds. The Board finds that, since it did not find the applicant's well-founded fear of persecution to be credible or objectively well-founded, it must also fail on the grounds of a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and danger of torture.\nISSUES", "032": "[32]\nThe applicant makes a brief argument regarding a typo (claimants, plural, instead of claimant, singular, in the decision), stating that this section of the reasons may have been taken from another case. The applicant cites Bojaxhi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 516, which states, at para 12, that the Court will not correct an error that goes to the heart of the decision, when the Board has not taken steps to make the amendments required to correct the problem.", "038": "[38]\nThe applicant closes on the IFA issue by stating that the Board failed to consider a material fact - that she is a 76-year-old woman, who, if returned to Sri Lanka, would be returning on her own, without a male protector. The applicant submits that the Board erred in finding a reasonable IFA in Colombo.", "054": "[54]\nHad the Applicant been able to establish a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, she would also have to show that this risk exists in the part of Sri Lanka specified in the IFA - Colombo. Again, it is well established that an individual need not pursue an Internal Flight Alternative if it is not objectively reasonable to do so or if it would cause undue hardship. In other words, and to quote Linden JA, \"an IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option\" (Thirunavukkarasu v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 F.C. 589 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 14).", "017": "[17]\nThe Board finds that there is no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be persecuted in Colombo because of her Tamil ethnicity.", "015": "[15]\nAfter credibility, the Board goes on to analyze the possibility of an IFA in Colombo, where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada. The Board notes that the documentary evidence pertaining to Colombo has changed over the last two years. The Board cites the Directorate Information and Refugee Board Issue Paper on Sri Lankan developments since the February 2003 cease-fire, issued in March 2003. The Board bases the Colombo IFA on two points: (1) the Colombo registration requirements are no longer in effect, which means that since 2002, there has been no complaints of police officers demanding registrations; and (2) In Colombo, most checkpoints and roadblocks were dismantled by January 2003, which in turn means that there were no reports of \"round-ups\" of Tamils in Colombo between October 2002 and March 2003.", "010": "[10]\nThe Board found her not to be a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, on February 3, 2004.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW", "008": "[8]\nShe was approached by the LTTE in Colombo, in May 2003, for the sum of twelve lakhs (approximately CDN$16,000) because she had children living abroad. She was told that, if she did not pay, she would be taken to Vanni and put in a bunker, just as they did to her husband in 1994.", "035": "[35]\nThe applicant also goes on to argue that the test for s. 97(1)(a) of the IRPA is different (and lower) from the test for section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, and definitely lower than the test under section 96. Focusing on the use of the word \"risk\" in section 97(1)(b), the Applicant contends that it is a standard quite a bit lower than the reasonable chance test that is used in the context of section 96.", "047": "[47]\nThe least that could have been expected from the Board was to give its reasons for casting doubt upon the applicant's credibility (Hilo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.); Mui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. no. 1294 (F.C. T.D.). In the present case, the Board concluded that the claimant came to Canada in order to be with her children, and rejected rather summarily her allegation of being a victim of extortion. The summary rejection was based on the implausibility of such an \"exorbitant\" amount of money, and an absence of evidence that elderly Tamils were being extorted in Colombo.", "013": "[13]\nThe delay in claiming is related to the 12 days between the applicant's arrival, and her refugee claim. The Board says it accepts the applicant's explanation of medical reasons.", "039": "[39]\nThe respondent submits that the test is higher under section 97(1) than under section 96 of the IRPA.", "056": "[56]\nFinally, there was some discussion as to the proper standard to be used in assessing the risk under section 97(1)(b). This was indeed a question that was certified for an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal under section 74(d) of the Act. Fortunately, we now have the benefit of the Court of Appeal's views, as they decided in Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 1, that the degree of risk under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b), is \"more likely than not\". Rothstein J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, also noted that the standard of proof to be applied, under both section 96 and section 97 of the IRPA, is the balance of probabilities test. The Board did not err in applying the balance of probabilities test, but, as it erred in the credibility finding, the decision must be set aside.", "006": "[6]\nAt this point, the applicant's son attempted to help her and her husband, and tried to sponsor them so that they could come to Canada. They went to Colombo to await the result of the sponsorship application. The sponsorship was rejected because the son did not have enough income.", "043": "[43]\nThe respondent says that the Board did note that the applicant had siblings in Vanni, and the north, but argues that the siblings are not the reason why the Board found a valid IFA in Colombo. The respondent says the Board found an IFA in Colombo based on the documentary evidence, and the applicant's personal circumstances. The personal circumstances included the fact that Colombo was the place where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada, that the applicant was educated in Sri Lanka at a time when English was one of the languages, and that she could receive medical care, and worship at the religious facility of her choice in Colombo.", "020": "[20]\nThe Board then goes on to the second prong of the two-prong test in Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 F.C. 706 (FCA) is met. The second part of the test is that conditions in that part of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge there. The Board says that the applicant has previously resided in Colombo, could receive medical care, and would be able to worship at a religious facility of her choice. The Board also notes that the applicant receives a government pension through her deceased husband's employment. The Board says there is no documentary evidence to indicate that hostilities between the LTTE and the government have recommenced.", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant, Mary Philomena Nesaratnam Anthonimuthu, is a 76-year-old citizen of Sri Lanka. She bases her well-founded fear of persecution on her ethnicity, and membership in a particular social group, namely Tamils who are extorted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).", "048": "[48]\nBearing in mind the words of caution of Muldoon J. in Valtchev, supra, and considering that terrorist organizations do not always act rationally, I do not find that twelve lakhs (1,200,000 rupees or approximately CDN$16,000) is an implausible amount of extortion. Indeed, the evidence reveals that the LTTE demanded up to 1,000,000 rupees for the release of kidnapped businessmen in 2001; (Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, U.S. Department of State, 2002, at page 6; Application Record, page 47). Since the LTTE knew that the Applicant had four children living in Canada, it is far from obvious that the claimant could not have been threatened with detention unless she paid 1,200,000 rupees.", "053": "[53]\nSince I have already concluded that the Applicant's allegations with respect to the threat of extortion have not been dealt with adequately by the Board, and were dismissed without much explanation, I can not rule out the possibility that the Applicant may have at least an arguable case under section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The deficiencies within the Board's credibility findings, in the context of section 96 undermine its findings under section 97.", "049": "[49]\nAs to the absence of reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large amounts of money in Colombo at the time alleged, nor that elderly Tamils were mistreated, the evidence is at best ambiguous. The U.S. Department of State Report mentions that the LTTE was responsible for extortion without confining this finding to a specific geographical zone. The Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board also reported in 2003 that, \"as a consequence of the ceasefire and the resulting ability of the LTTE to now move freely in government controlled areas, the LTTE has reportedly been able to extend its extortion activity into new territory, particularly the towns of Batticaloa and Karaitivu\".", "011": "[11]\nThe Board found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, for the following reasons:\na. Credibility;\nb. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution - Internal Flight Alternative (IFA); and\nc.

The Board found that because there was no more than a mere possibility of persecution, a claim under s. 97 had to be ruled out. The applicant cites Bouaouni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C. 1211 as authority that section 97 requires a separate analysis, given that there was credible evidence.", "009": "[9]\nThe applicant came to Canada on July 5 2003, and filed for refugee protection on July 17, 2003.", "012": "[12]\nThe Board challenges the applicant's credibility on two grounds:\n(a) a delay in claiming refugee status, and (b) plausibility of the applicant's story.", "028": "[28]\nThe applicant also points out that sworn statement by an applicant are presumed to be true, unless there is a juridical reason to find otherwise, and submits that absence of corroboration is not such a reason.", "030": "[30]\nThe respondent replies that the Board is entitled to make findings regarding plausibility of a claim, and it is in the best position to do so, having had the opportunity to see and hear from the applicant, and to assess the evidence as regards the allegations and assessments, which lie within the expertise of the Board. The respondent says the applicant has failed to show that the Board's findings were perverse of capricious.", "051": "[51]\nThe Applicant also contends that the Refugee Division erred in not assessing her claim under section 97 of the IRPA, taking it for granted that she must fail on the grounds of a risk to like or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and danger to torture if she could not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. This Court has repeated on a number of occasions that the analysis under section 97 is different from the analysis required under section 96 and that claims made under both sections therefore warrant separate treatment. The Court said, in Bouaouni, supra, at paragraph 41:\nIt follows that a negative credibility determination, which may be determinative of a refugee claim under s. 96 of the Act, is not necessarily determinative of a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. The elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 of the Act where a well-founder [sic] fear of persecution to a convention ground must be established. Although the evidentiary basis may well be the same for both claims, it is essential that both claims be considered as separate.", "036": "[36]\nAs a consequence, the applicant argues that the test for s.96 was inappropriately applied, in that the word \"would\" was used in the test. The phrase used by the Board is: \"The panel finds that there is not more than a mere possibility that the claimants [sic] would be persecuted in Colombo\". The applicant says that the use of the word \"would\" creates the impression that a balance of probabilities test was used.", "004": "[4]\nThe applicant says her family suffered a lot due to ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka.

While defendant's counsel took me to several examples of requests for admissions that were more properly within the Court's domain as questions of claim construction, that does not explain why the bulk of the admissions sought were either summarily dismissed or ignored, requiring that the plaintiff tender evidence that would not otherwise have been required. For example, evidence relating to admissions made by the defendant's expert, Dr. Barudi, in the U.S. proceedings did not need to be proved at trial and would have reduced the scope of the Phillips' affidavit. Information respecting the schedule of trade shows attended by both parties was within the defendant's knowledge and should not have required preparation and testimony. Further, particulars respecting the employment by CFM of one Colm Martin should have been admitted.\n(o) other- willful infringement", "033": "[33]\nBy CFM's calculations, the total amount of fees that should be awarded under Column III would be no more than $100,000. CFM also contends that the plaintiff's disbursements, notwithstanding the reduction in the amended proposal, continue to be excessive and should be limited to $150,000. It further argues that the total lump sum amount should be reduced by a factor of at least 25% as Dimplex was not successful in its allegation that punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded. As a result, CFM submits that Dimplex's costs be fixed between $150,000 and $200,000 in total for both fees and disbursements.", "037": "[37]\nThe other disputed disbursement item is a claim for photocopies. Dimplex initially claimed $45,982.77 including GST at an in house rate of $.25 per page. CFM proposed a reduction by $13,981.08 to reflect a commercial rate of $.14 per page and removal of an additional $3,993.47 for what it considered unnecessary copying. Dimplex accepted the latter reduction but not the former. While I appreciate that a claim for in-house copying should reflect the actual costs incurred, I note that Assessment Officer Stinson has concluded that $0.25 per page is reasonable and would defer to his considerable experience in these matters:\nCanadian Union of Public Employees, Airline Division, Local 4004 v. Air Canada\n, [1998] F.C.J. No. 464; 157 F.T.R. 186 (T.D.), at para. 7. I did not consider it necessary to take this dispute into account in arriving at a lump sum award as the amount to be awarded will in any event fall well short of Dimplex' actual costs.", "041": "[41]\nThe question of the date from which interest should be calculated was addressed by Gibson, J., in\nCCH Canadian Ltd. et al. v.

Law Society of Upper Canada\n(2004), 243 D.L.R.(4th) 759; 2004 FCA 278. I conclude from those reasons that interest on costs should normally flow from the date of the trial judgment in which costs are awarded a party unless an assessment is ordered, in which case they should be calculated from the date of that order. CFM did not dispute that post-judgment interest was payable but submitted that it should be simple and not compounded. I am satisfied that this award shall bear interest from the date of the trial judgment, May 11, 2006 at five percent (5%) not compounded as provided for by s. 127 of the\nCourts of Justice Act\n.\nORDER", "031": "[31]\nThese alternate proposals from Dimplex are put forward largely because of its estimation of the defendant's current financial situation as precarious.

As noted by the Court in\nAird\n, above at para. 6: \"[a]s a general rule, costs should follow the event. Absent an abuse of process, a successful plaintiff should not be penalized simply because not all the points advanced by the plaintiff have found favour with the court\". The Court found in that case that as the issues in the action were not complex, the matter was mainly factually driven, and the fact that the plaintiffs were successful in relation to all but two\nsubsidiary issues\n, the defendant's success on those two issues was not a significant enough reason for the Court to depart from this general rule (at para. 9).", "040": "[40]\nBy virtue of s. 37(1) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, the law of Ontario relating to interest on judgments is applicable to this case. Section 129(1) of the Ontario\nCourts of Justice Act\n, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43 (\nCourts of Justice Act\n), would seem at first impression to indicate that interest should be calculated from the date of the order fixing the costs rather than from the date of the trial judgment. However, the section has been interpreted as requiring that interest on costs be payable from the date of judgment rather than from the date of assessment. I note that under paragraph 130(1)(c) of the\nCourts of Justice Act\n, the Court has a discretion to allow interest for a period other than that provided under s. 129(1).", "042": "[42]\nFOR THE REASONS SET OUT ABOVE", "024": "[24]\nThis is not a case where the volume of work done by the plaintiff was due to the nature of the invention:\nMonsanto Canada Inc. et al. v.

The requirement to prove ingenuity may have added some time to the trial as the physical exhibits, electric fireplaces, had to be dismantled to demonstrate their inner workings but that was not a significant factor in my view.", "019": "[19]\nThe defendant's argument regarding the punitive damages claim and its call for a reduction in the plaintiff's cost award by at least 25% as a result is an issue that is appropriately considered in the context of this factor, but, in my view, not persuasive. The fact that the plaintiff won in regards to validity and infringement, but lost with respect to its punitive damages claim is relevant but not an indication of divided success. The punitive damages claim was subsidiary to the main issues of validity and infringement at trial and on those the plaintiff was completely successful. It was also reasonable for the plaintiff to attempt to make the case for punitive damages although I concluded that the evidence fell short of meeting the Canadian test. That being said, I had no difficulty finding that the infringement was deliberate.\n(e) any written offer to settle", "022": "[22]\nThere is no real controversy between the parties that these efforts to settle must be taken into account in assessing costs in the present case. I note that the defendant's solicitors actively participated, to the extent of exchanging draft terms, in attempting to reach a settlement which would have been reasonable for both sides. I find it difficult to understand why these efforts were not pursued to a resolution of the action prior to trial. Perhaps the only explanation is as Dimplex suggests.

In the event that the Court was not persuaded that solicitor-client costs were warranted, Dimplex alternatively proposed that its legal fees be fixed on a party and party scale in accordance with Column V of Tariff B until March 28, 2005, and that the fees be tripled from March 28, 2005 to the end of trial for a total of $500,000.

These constituted genuine attempts to reach a compromise. At the outset, the action could have been easily resolved with each party bearing its own costs if CFM had been prepared to alter its use of the infringing screen technology. After Dimplex had succeeded at trial in the U.S. proceedings in March 2005 and was awarded damages of $8.3 million, Dimplex offered in writing to settle both the U.S. and Canadian actions for $7.2 million, a substantial saving for CFM. The U.S. District Court subsequently increased the award to $12.4 million because of the jury's finding of wilful infringement. Dimplex then offered in writing to settle both actions for $10 million payable over two years, and again, on the eve of the trial in this action, for $9 million. Each of these offers would have resulted in substantial savings to CFM.", "032": "[32]\nCFM acknowledges that Dimplex is entitled to reasonable party and party costs.

Dimplex submits that Canadian counsel participated in those depositions and it should be entitled to recovery for those costs. In the circumstances, that is a reasonable proposition as Dimplex's Canadian counsel had to be prepared to rely upon the U.S. depositions in this action.", "038": "[38]\nThis is not a case in which I would award solicitor-client costs as the defendant's conduct while deserving of censure was not so reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous as to justify them. For that reason, I was satisfied that general damages or an accounting for profits would act as a sufficient deterrent.

However, as the defendant points out, even in the case of settlement offers that do qualify under Rule 420, a doubling of costs is the default unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

It is only when the Court does not make a specific order otherwise that costs will be assessed in accordance with column III of Tariff B.\n\"10\nThe Court, therefore, does have discretion to depart from the Tariff, especially where it considers an award of costs according to the Tariff to be unsatisfactory\n. Further, the amount of solicitor-and-client costs, while not determinative of an appropriate party-and-party contribution, may be taken into account when the Court considers it appropriate to do so. Discretion should be prudently exercised.

In this respect, the Court must have regard to the factors it considers reasonable within Rule 400(3) of the\nFederal Court Rules\n, as described in further detail below. The default for an award of costs remains Tariff B, Column III. Where an award of increased costs is warranted, the Court should first determine whether an award of costs that is reasonable is possible within the scope of Tariff B. Only where that would dictate an unreasonable or unsatisfactory result, should the Court consider awarding an amount in excess of the Tariff.\nWhat is the effect of the Dimplex settlement offers with respect to Rule 420?", "028": "[28]\nIt is not enough to say that because the plaintiff lost its claim for punitive damages, willful infringement is not an issue to be considered in the assessment of costs. The plaintiff is not trying to re-litigate its punitive damages claim as asserted by the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff reasonably contends that the Court should consider under the scope of the discretion granted to it pursuant to Rule 400(3)(o), that the defendant did not innocently breach Dimplex's rights, but did so knowingly. I was satisfied from the evidence that this was established. CFM was unable to come up with a competitive alternative and chose to copy a proven success.

In the first alternate proposal, the fees from the date of its last settlement offer to the conclusion of the trial would be tripled for a total lump sum of $0.53 million.

CFM was then a large and prosperous enterprise with a diverse product line. Dimplex North America, while a subsidiary of a foreign corporation, was smaller and less diversified. Its core business was the line of electric fireplaces it developed with the patented technology. Other competitors were tempted to follow CFM's example.

Such short reasons, made in generic terms, make it difficult to ascertain whether there has been a reasonable and thorough examination of the application. The reasons do not offer a transparent look at the reasoning of the officer and therefore cannot withstand a probing examination.", "006": "[6]\nThe officer states that much of the material provided deals with the family's efforts to establish and integrate into the community. The officer notes that:\nAlthough establishment can be a factor to consider in assessing hardship for this family...the subjects have provided insufficient evidence to satisfy me that their establishment is such that asking them to apply oversea [sic] would present an excessive hardship.\nThey have demonstrated that they are highly motivated and dedicated. They all appear to be deeply involved in their church and the community through that church.\nThe subject came to Canada as a visitor and was granted an extension based on a contract as a pastor at a church. However he commenced unauthorized employment outside the church. When his request to stay was refused and he was asked to leave he made a refugee claim which was refused. He and his family are now subject to effective removal orders.\nThe subject has not demonstrated that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant an exemption to subsection 11(1) of IRPA.\nBased on the evidence provided I am not satisfied that the subject would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if the subject were to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada.

If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere... This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling ...(citations omitted).\nWere the officer's reasons sufficient?", "028": "[28]\nI conclude, therefore, that the reasons do not withstand a somewhat probing scrutiny.

He wanted his children to learn more creatively and to be exposed to different ways of thinking rather than from simply memorizing the textbook. He says that his children had successfully adapted to the educational system in Canada and that his son in particular, who was just 9 years old when they came here, would find it difficult to adjust to the Korean educational system. Mr. Kim refers to his own difficulties in finding employment in Korea and says he would find it hard to begin again. The IRB decision found that his evidence was credible and candid about his economic prospects.", "001": "[1]\nMosley, J.\n: The primary issue in thisapplication for judicial review is whether the officer's reasons for refusing an exemption from visa requirements on humanitarian and compassionate grounds are adequate. As I have concluded they are not, this application will be granted for the following reasons.", "016": "[16]\nThe respondent submits that, other than establishment, there are no compelling factors argued by the applicants with regard to why it would constitute \"undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship\" if they were to apply from South Korea.

These individuals are part of the state apparatus at the local and national levels, and, as such, are presumed to have knowledge of its protection capabilities.", "037": "[37]\nGiven the importance of these declarations in proving the inability of the state to offer protection to Mr. Elezi, it was incumbent upon the PRRA officer to take into account relevant factors in conducting his assessment.

In\nDunsmuir v. New Brunswick\n, 2008 SCC 9, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that in lieu of the previous three standards: patent unreasonableness, reasonableness\nsimpliciter\n, and correctness, there will now be two applicable standards, correctness and reasonableness.", "029": "[29]\nThis contrasts with a previous judicial review pertaining to the admissibility of \"new\" evidence under s.103 of the Act, where these same letters were considered significant as they lend credibility to the applicant's claim (\nElezi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2007 FC 240, [2007] F.C.J. No. 357 (QL)). In that case Justice de Montigny stated:\nAll of this evidence is obviously extremely probative, and to a large extent, refutes all of the Board's conclusions against Mr. Elezi [...] That evidence goes to the very heart of the Board's conclusion, and certainly tends to confirm not only Mr. Elezi's story but also the risk he would be facing were he to be returned to Albania.\" (\nElezi\n,\nsupra\n, at paras. 38 and 44).\nWhile these comments were made in\nobiter\nand thus not binding upon the PRRA officer, in my view, at minimum, they offer some guidance in how to approach the new evidence.", "023": "[23]\nIn providing guidance as to what the appropriate standard of review will be in a given case, the Court indicated that\n[...] questions of fact, discretion and policy as well as questions where the legal issues cannot be easily separated from the factual issues generally attract a standard of reasonableness while many legal issues attract a standard of correctness. Some legal issues, however, attract the more deferential standard of reasonableness. (at para. 51)\nFurther, the Court emphasized the two-step nature of the judicial review process:\nFirst, courts ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of defence to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question.

While the PRRA process is not an appeal from a Board decision, there would be no point in admitting new evidence capable of contradicting a finding of fact by the Board, if it then could be given little probative value for the very reason that it was admitted. Thus, where new evidence is admitted that contradicts the Board's previous findings of fact, the evidence cannot be discounted solely because it contradicts prior conclusions, rather the capacity of the new evidence to temper those findings for the purposes of the present PRRA analysis must be evaluated.", "013": "[13]\nThe application for judicial review of the negative PRRA decision was granted on March 1, 2007 by this Court.", "039": "[39]\nI note that the applicant submitted a second declaration from Mr. Bano (page 323 of the Tribunal Record).

Of more relevance to the issue of state protection, the applicant submitted letters from state officials, the Mayor of Lushnje, Mr. Gega, and an Albanian Member of Parliament, Mr. Bano, which indicated that Albania could not protect him. While these letters explicitly state that Albanian authorities cannot protect the applicant, they were accorded little probative value and not mentioned by the officer in the state protection analysis.", "030": "[30]\nIn his reasons, the officer indicated that he gave little weight to the declarations of Mr. Bano, and Mr. Gega for the following reasons: they were based on hearsay; Mr. Bano admitted to being a friend of the applicant's father and thus his evidence was not disinterested; the declarations discussed facts that the Board had already rejected for lacking credibility and for which the Board found that the applicant waited six months before leaving Albania, thus undermining the subjective nature of his fear; and finally, because no \"good reason\" had been provided as to why the declarations were not submitted before the Board.", "036": "[36]\nThe officer also discounted the evidence because no \"good reason\" had been provided as to why the declarations were not submitted before the Board. In my view, this is not a relevant consideration. By accepting the declarations as new evidence pursuant to s.113(a) of the Act, the officer also implicitly accepts that the applicant had a valid reason for not submitting these declarations to the Board. Indeed, as noted in the previous\nElezi\ndecision:\n[...] the Board's hearing took place only three months after he arrived in Canada, and it does not require a stretch of the imagination to consider that this is not much time to gather that kind of evidence.

It is also true that it was not until the hearing was underway that C\u00e9dric's Belgian nationality became known, as the result of new retroactive legislation introduced in Belgium. However, the IRB erred by failing to appoint an independent counsel for C\u00e9dric, as required by s. 69(4) of the\nAct\nand by s. 15 of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n. By not giving C\u00e9dric an opportunity to be heard, the panel also infringed the audi alteram partem rule (\nMaricic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(2002), 219 F.T.R. 229; 2002 FCT 510 (T.D.)). This denial of procedural fairness in my opinion suffices to vitiate the IRB's decision. In\nCardinal and Oswald v. Kent Institution (Director)\n, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643; 63 N.R. 353, at 661, the Supreme Court of Canada said:\n\"If this be a correct view of the implications of the approach of the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the issue of procedural fairness in this case, I find it necessary to affirm that\nthe denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision\n. The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there been a hearing.\" (My emphasis.)", "022": "[22]\nFinally, the plaintiffs complained that the IRB was too receptive to the many requests for adjournment made by the Minister's representative, over the objections and protests of their counsel. In view of the fact that from time to time the plaintiffs themselves needed delays and the fact that the Court was not persuaded that this caused them any serious harm, I do not find any infringement of the plaintiffs' rights. In this connection, the possibility that the plaintiffs' chances of obtaining refugee status elsewhere than in Canada being reduced by their residence in this country is not a persuasive argument, since in the circumstances it is ordinarily the time that the refugee protection application in question is made, not the time taken to dispose of that application, that is taken into account.", "023": "[23]\nFor all these reasons, no error justifying review by this Court has been established for the case of the principal plaintiff and her daughter Astrid and accordingly their application cannot be allowed. At the same time, where the plaintiff C\u00e9dric Bicamumpaka, less than 18 years of age, is concerned, the application for judicial review must be allowed on the grounds that the IRB failed to comply with the requirement of s. 69(4) of the\nAct\n, by not designating another person to represent him, and that the panel also erred by not giving him an opportunity of being heard separately.", "014": "[14]\nIn\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Article 1E must be read in a more purposive light so as to provide safe haven to those who genuinely need it, not to give a quick and convenient route to landed status for immigrants who cannot or will not obtain it in the usual way. I therefore fully agree with the Federal Court of Appeal decision in the\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration v. Mahdi\n, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1623 (QL) (FCA) at para. 12, that 'the real question that the Board had to decide in this case was whether the respondent was, when she applied for admission to Canada, a person who was still recognized by the competent authorities of the United States as a permanent resident of that country'.\"", "005": "[5]\nThe IRB found that as C\u00e9dric had Belgium nationality he benefited from the protection that any Belgian national could have in Belgium and so could not claim Canada's protection.", "021": "[21]\nAt page 1 of its decision the IRB indicated that the plaintiffs had objected to a particular question put by the Minister's representative to the Belgian Embassy, a question contained in Exhibit M-21. The objection was taken [Translation] \"under advisement\", but the IRB considered that it was no longer necessary to decide it since the exclusion clause did not apply to Belgium. If the objection was against production of the document the IRB erred by relying on Exhibit M-21 at page 7 of its decision. However, even if the IRB erred, the error is not fatal to its decision as Exhibit M-21 was not in any way used to support any of the reasons for its decision.", "017": "[17]\nThe plaintiffs further maintained that at no time during the many hearing sessions did the IRB separate the claim of the child C\u00e9dric from that of his mother and sister. They also objected that the panel did not designated an ad hoc representative for C\u00e9dric or offer the latter an opportunity of speaking.", "015": "[15]\nIn the case at bar the plaintiffs lost their right to return to Cameroon when they left with forged documents, thereby failing to comply with s. 29 of the Cameroon relevant legislation. If they had tried to return to Cameroon at once, they would have been denied entry under s. 32 of the said law. This means that the plaintiffs did not have the right to return to Cameroon when they appeared at the point of entry to Canada. However, they lost their status in Cameroon through their own fault. They alleged that they used forged documents because of fear of the Cameroon authorities.

As we know, in questions of credibility it is not this Court's function to take the place of the administrative tribunal when, as here, the plaintiff fails to show that its decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (s. 18.1(4)(d) of the\nFederal Court Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c.

It is well settled that the IRB is a specialized tribunal which has the power of assessing the plausibility and credibility of testimony so long as the inferences it draws are not unreasonable (\nAguebor v.

In the case at bar, after reviewing the evidence I am not persuaded that the IRB made any manifest and overriding error of fact. The IRB dismissed the plaintiff's testimony about her fear of returning to Cameroon because the plaintiffs waited three months after the attack before leaving. The IRB regarded as not credible the explanation given by the plaintiff that she did not wish to alarm her children again and so waited for the end of the school year before leaving. In view of the plaintiff's testimony that she continued working for those three months, and that the plaintiffs did not alter their way of life in any way, the IRB's finding that the plaintiff's conduct contradicted her alleged fear was not unreasonable. Apart from the attack described above, no other specific event was mentioned in which the plaintiffs were targets, either for the death squads or the Cameroon authorities. The legal arrest of the plaintiff's husband does not as such suffice to show that the plaintiffs were then in danger of persecution. Based on the facts in evidence the panel was justified in concluding that it was not reasonable for the plaintiffs not to have an exit visa as required by Cameroon law, and that they could not then rely on the lack of a right to return as a means of arguing that the exclusion clause should not be applied.", "003": "[3]\nThe female plaintiff's husband was arrested in Cameroon and is currently being held awaiting trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for war crimes and crimes against humanity.", "007": "[7]\nThe plaintiffs maintained that the IRB erred in applying the exclusion clause in section 1(E) of the schedule to the\nAct\n, as the testimonial and documentary evidence was that they did not have any vested rights in Cameroon.

The Regulations permit the applicant to be assessed in \"an occupation\". The factors listed in column I of Schedule I require that the experience of the applicant be assessed with regard to his intended occupation. There is no reason why the actual experience and time spent in each of the various responsibilities in an occupation cannot be broken down to award units of assessment for experience in intended occupations. Paragraph 15 of the Baker affidavit, which I quoted previously, makes this quite clear.", "005": "[5]\nAs a further expression of general principle, it is useful to refer to the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent of John Lynn Baker, Director of Immigration and Refugee Affairs Division, External Affairs Canada.

The record must equally indicate reasons which support the visa officer's assignment of a specific experience rating to the included occupations or reasons which support the refusal to do so. Obviously, having erroneously concluded that no assessment need be done, the visa officer in this case failed in this aspect of the duty of fairness.", "010": "[10]\nThe applicant is from India and was a temporary resident of New Jersey.

The officer asked about the applicant's main duties and was informed that he was involved in purchasing, selling, supervising employees and accounting. In response to further questions, the officer was told there were seven to nine employees, all tailors.

Above all, it is important to bear in mind that Parliament's intention in enacting the Immigration Act is to define Canada's immigration policy both to Canadians and to those who wish to come here from abroad. Such a policy cannot exist without complex regulations, a good many of which appear to be restrictive in nature, but the policy should always be interpreted in positive terms. The purpose of the statute is to permit immigration, not prevent it. It follows that applicants have the right to frame their application in a way that maximizes their chances for entry.

Such applications involve a two-stage assessment process during which it is the visa officer's duty to apply criteria set forth in the legislation and award points based on the ability of the applicant to become successfully established in Canada. The criteria for successful establishment include age, education, occupational demand and experience, language and personal suitability. The first phase of the assessment is a paper screening process in which immigration officials evaluate documents submitted by applicants and decide if the application process should be continued. If the applicant passes this phase, he is invited to an interview with a visa officer. Obviously, one of the most significant factors in any assessment is the applicant's possibility of employment in Canada. Points are therefore awarded both for occupational demand in the paper screening step, and for experience in the final assessment. The process also requires recourse to the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (C.C.D.O.), a seven volume manual which classifies and describes thousands of occupations. Assessment of any one intended occupation begins with a matching of the applicant's work routine with a specific occupation from the C.C.D.O.", "007": "[7]\nIt is also important to emphasize that the Immigration Act in s. 6 requires that those seeking landing in Canada must satisfy an immigration officer that they meet the selection standards set out in the Immigration Regulations, 1978.

Entitlement to a pension is provided under s. 21 of the\nPension Act\n. Pension eligibility differs depending on whether the person concerned was a member of the Forces during war or in peace time: if service was during war, it is paragraph 21(1)(a) that applies; if in peace time, it is paragraph 21(2)(a).

No. 850; 2001 FCT 535 (at paragraph 65), paragraph 21(2)(a) is more narrow in scope than paragraph 21(1)(a). While the latter refers to an injury or disease 'that was attributable to or was incurred during such military service', paragraph 21(2)(a) refers instead to an injury or disease 'that arose out of or was directly connected with such military service'. In other words, the member of the Forces who suffered an injury or disease in peace time must establish that military service was the 'primary cause' of the injury or the disability and must establish causation.

The provision specifies that an injury or disease shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, 'to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service' if it was incurred in the course of any of the circumstances listed in the subsection's various paragraphs:\n'Presumption\n'(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), an injury or disease, or the aggravation of an injury or disease, shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service of the kind described in that subsection if the injury or disease or the aggravation thereof was incurred in the course of\n(a) any physical training or any sports activity in which the member was participating that was authorized or organized by a military authority, or performed in the interests of the service although not authorized or organized by a military authority;\n(b) any activity incidental to or directly connected with an activity described in paragraph (a), including the transportation of the member by any means between the place the member normally performed duties and the place of that activity;\n(c) the transportation of the member, in the course of duties, in a military vessel, vehicle or aircraft or by any means of transportation authorized by a military authority, or any act done or action taken by the member or any other person that was incidental to or directly connected with that transportation;\n(d) the transportation of the member while on authorized leave by any means authorized by a military authority, other than public transportation, between the place the member normally performed duties and the place at which the member was to take leave or a place at which public transportation was available;\n(e) service in an area in which the prevalence of the disease contracted by the member, or that aggravated an existing disease or injury of the member, constituted a health hazard to persons in that area;\n(f) any military operation, training or administration, either as a result of a specific order or established military custom or practice, whether or not failure to perform the act that resulted in the disease or injury or aggravation thereof would have resulted in disciplinary action against the member; and\n(g) the performance by the member of any duties that exposed the member to an environmental hazard that might reasonably have caused the disease or injury or the aggravation thereof.'\n. . . . .\n[translation omitted]\n\"26. Attention should also be drawn to s. 2 of the\nPension Act\nand s. 3 of the\nBoard Act\n, which call for a broad and liberal construction and interpretation of the provisions of these two statutes in recognition of what the members of the Forces have done for their country. These provisions read as follows:\n'\nPension Act\n:\n'CONSTRUCTION\n'\nConstruction\n'2. The provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to provide compensation to those members of the forces who have been disabled or have died as a result of military service, and to their dependants, may be fulfilled.'\n. . . . .\n[translation omitted]\n'\nBoard Act\n:\n'Construction\n'3. The provisions of this Act and of any other Act of Parliament or of any regulations made under this or any other Act of Parliament conferring or imposing jurisdiction, powers, duties or functions on the Board shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled.'\n. . . . .\n[translation omitted]\n\"27. Finally, another provision that must be taken into account is s. 39 of the\nBoard Act\n, which sets out rules favouring the applicant with respect to his or her burden of proof:\n'Rules of evidence\n'39. In all proceedings under this Act, the Board shall\n(a) draw from all the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant or appellant;\n(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances; and\n(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case.'\n. . . . .\n[translation omitted]\n\"28. This provision, which generally gives the applicant or appellant the benefit of the doubt, has occasioned much debate over the nature of the evidence that will allow the applicant or appellant to succeed. The decisions of this Court and of the Court of Appeal instruct us that the effect of this provision is not to compel the Board to accept all of the allegations made by a veteran. Under the terms of paragraph 21(2)(a), the applicant must establish, on the standard of proof applicable in civil matters (a balance of probabilities), that he or she suffers from a disability and that this disability arose out of or was directly connected with his or her military service. It is the member who must prove causation between the alleged incident and the condition cited. Justice Sharlow, writing for the Court of Appeal, summarized the impact of s. 39 well in\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Wannamaker\n, 2007 FCA 126, at paragraphs 5 and 6:\n'Section 39 ensures that the evidence in support of a pension application is considered in the best light possible. However, s. 39 does not relieve the pension applicant of the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities the facts required to establish entitlement to a pension:\nWood v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(2001), 199 F.T.R. 133 (F.C.T.D.);\nCundell v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(2000), 180 F.T.R. 193 (F.C.T.D).\n'Nor does s. 39 require the Board to accept all evidence presented by the applicant. The Board is not obliged to accept evidence presented by the applicant if the Board finds that evidence not to be credible, even if the evidence is not contradicted, although the Board may be obliged to explain why it finds evidence not to be credible:\nMacDonald v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1999), 164 F.T.R. 42, at paragraphs 22 and 29. Evidence is credible if it is plausible, reliable and logically capable of proving the fact it is intended to prove.\n'See also:\nNisbet v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, 2004 FC 1106, at paras. 17-19;\nMoar v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, 2006 FC 610, at paras. 10 and 29;\nCurrie v.

Canada (Attorney General)\n, 2004 FC 751.'\n. . . . .\n\"36. The Court must therefore ask itself whether the Board's decision, in terms of both form and substance, can be considered reasonable. In terms of form, the reasonableness of the decision will be assessed according to its justification, transparency and intelligibility, whereas in terms of substance, it must fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (\nDunsmuir\n, above, at paragraph 47). As the Supreme Court took pains to point out, this new single standard does not call for greater judicial interference in the administrative process. Indeed, the courts must not lose sight of the fact that such questions when submitted to administrative boards and tribunals can often lead to more than one reasonable outcome and that it is not up to the reviewing court to substitute the decision it might have made if it, and not the administrative board or tribunal, had dealt with the question.\"\nT-288-10: Hearing Loss", "037": "[37]\nIn the Applicant's view, the Board has \"an obligation to make reasonable decisions, not to frivolously decide a case based on how much medical information is at hand.\"", "058": "[58]\nIt appears to me that, in the present case, Mr. Lunn's medical records constitute the \"evidence to the contrary\" to which Justice Blais refers in paragraph 32.

The fact that the hearing loss and degenerative disc disease were not detected until many years after his release from the military makes causation that much harder to establish.", "079": "[79]\nThe new medical opinion from Dr. Lalonde, date-stamped 20 October 2009 actually supports the Board's conclusions because it makes it clear that the Applicant's lumbar disc disease cannot be said to have been caused by what happened during military service and could be \"just a natural aging process or brought on and extenuated (sic) by the fact that he is significantly overweight.\"", "065": "[65]\nFinally, the case of\nWeare v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1145; 153 F.T.R. 75 (T.D.), shares a number of similarities with the instant case, including a long passage of time between the injury and the pension application. In that case, the Board found that the medical evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that the condition pertaining to the lumbar spine was attributable to the Regular Force service or that there was any linkage between the spinal condition and the already pensioned condition of bilateral pes planus. The applicant was discharged in 1959 and applied for a disability pension in 1994. Justice MacKay stated as follows:\n\"19. Yet, the Board may reject the applicant's medical evidence when it has before it contradictory medical evidence, as noted by Mr. Justice Cullen in\nRe Hornby\n. Further, ss. 3 and 39 of the [\nVAB\n]\nAct\ndo not mean that whatever submission is made by a veteran, that submission must automatically be accepted by the members of the Board. The evidence must be credible and must be reasonable. Finally, there is an obligation on the veteran to present evidence suggesting a causal link between service in the Forces and the ailment of which he or she complains. In the words of Madame Justice Reed in\nHall v. Canada (Attorney General)\n:\n'While the applicant correctly asserts that uncontradicted evidence by him should be accepted unless a lack of credibility finding is made, and that every reasonable inference should be drawn, and any reasonable doubt resolved in his favour, he still has the obligation to demonstrate that the medical difficulty from which he now suffers arose out of or in connection with his military service; that is, the causal linkage must be established.'\n\"20. In the case at bar, having examined the record that was before the Board, while there is little doubt the applicant suffers from knee and hearing ailments, I can find little if any evidence offered by the applicant demonstrating a causal link between his military service and these ailments. On the other hand, the report prepared by the Medical Advisory Directorate indicates that the hearing loss is not attributable to military service and that there is no evidence supporting a conclusion that the knee problems originated from service in the armed forces.\n\"21. On this basis, it is my view that it cannot be said that the Board came to a patently unreasonable finding or that it failed to weigh medical evidence in a proper fashion in relation to the claims by Mr. Weare in regard to his knees and his hearing. In the absence of any evidence of causality presented by the applicant, it is not open to the Board to conclude that such causality exists where medical reports it has requested suggest otherwise. In these circumstances, the Board cannot simply infer that ailments developing many years after Mr. Weare's discharge from the services were caused by his fall while in training in 1958.\"", "008": "[8]\nIn January 2010, the Veterans Review Appeal Board affirmed the earlier decisions to deny the pension claim.", "061": "[61]\nJustice Teitelbaum's decision in\nCundell v.

In that case, which is a judicial review of a rejected pension claim, the medical expert reported that the cause of the applicant's injury was \"unclear\" and that it was impossible to say if military service contributed to the applicant's injury. Justice Teitelbaum observed as follows:\n\"59 It may be a fact that the etiology of sarcoidosis is unclear but what is not 'unclear' is that all x-rays of the applicant before he went to the Persian Gulf showed no problem with his lungs and\nupon return or soon thereafter\n, the x-rays of the applicant's lungs show the sarcoidosis.\" (my emphasis)", "035": "[35]\nAlthough the Applicant consulted a military doctor about the running and snow-shovelling incident in 1991 when he was stationed in Cold Lake, Alberta, the Applicant observes that there is \"next to no information\" on his medical file regarding his back injury.

Canada (Minister of Veterans Affairs)\n(2007), 321 F.T.R. 141; 2007 FC 1322, involved a judicial review of the decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs denying the applicant's eligibility for reimbursement of Chronic Care expenses. The applicant had served with the Canadian Armed Forces in the Second World War during which time he was injured, for which he received a small pension from DVA. The applicant was placed in a long-term care facility, for which DVA agreed to pay but refused reimbursement retroactive to the date that the applicant entered the care. inter alia, the applicant sought certain declarations as to the\nCharter\n. Justice Hughes relied upon the Supreme Court of Canada decision in\nLaw v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497; 236 N.R. 1, to decide the application of s. 15 to the facts of that case:\n\"29. The Applicants further argue that s. 15(1) of the\nCharter\napplies and that Horace, as a veteran no longer mentally competent to deal with his affairs, has been deprived of equal benefits. The Supreme Court of Canada in\nLaw v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\n, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, canvassed what a claimant must first established before the\nCharter\n, s. 15, comes into play. Binnie, J., for the Court summarized three factors at paragraph 23: (1) whether a law imposes differential treatment between the claimant and others; (2) whether an enumerated or analogous ground of discrimination is the basis for the differential treatment; and (3) whether the law in question has a 'discriminatory' purpose or effect.\n\"30. Applicants' Counsel argues that the\nRegulations\nfail to make provision for care of or access by those who are not mentally competent. This is not a 'discriminatory' provision of the\nRegulations\nbut, taking the argument at its best, failure to make special provision for one particular group of persons. There is no 'discrimination' in the\nRegulations\n, all persons are treated the same, no group directly or indirectly is discriminated against and application of the\nRegulations\ndoes not have a discriminatory effect. The Applicants simply do not get beyond point (1) of the\nLaw\ntest.\n\"31. Further, the Applicants fail the third branch of the\nLaw\ntest. As set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in\nGranovsky v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\n, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 703; 2000 SCC 28 at paragraph 58, while a financial deprivation may exist it must be shown that the legislation promotes the view that a person is less capable or less worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society:\n'The question therefore is not just whether the appellant has suffered the deprivation of a financial benefit, which he has, but whether the deprivation promotes the view that persons with temporary disabilities are \"less capable, or less worthy of recognition or value as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally deserving of concern, respect, and consideration\" (emphasis added). In\nMiron v. Trudel\n, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418, McLachlin, J., noted, at para. 132, that \"distinctions made on enumerated or analogous grounds may prove to be, upon examination, non-discriminatory\".'\n\"32. Nothing in the\nRegulations\nhas been shown to diminish the sense of capability or worth or value of mentally incompetent veterans. The\nRegulations\nprovide a scheme whereby benefits may be provided, nothing in that scheme reflects badly on a person in any way contemplated by\nGranovsky\n.\n\"33. Thus, I find that the\nCharter\ndoes not assist the Applicants. Therefore, I do not have to address the issue as to whether reliance upon the\nCharter\ncan survive Horace's death.\"", "062": "[62]\nIn other words, Justice Teitelbaum found a causative link between military service and the injury because, in\nCundell\n, there was a record of an injury while the applicant was in the service, and there was a short timeline between the causative injury and the manifestation of the condition. Having found the causative link, Justice Teitelbaum was able to engage the s. 21(3) presumption to find that the Board should have interpreted the doctor's letter so as to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt, as is required under s. 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n.", "009": "[9]\nOn 2 March 2010, the Applicant commenced this application for judicial review of the Board's decision denying his claim for a disability pension based on hearing loss.\nT-289-10: Degenerative Disc Disease of the Lumbar Spine", "012": "[12]\nThe Applicant claims that his disability, which is attributable to the above-noted back injuries, is totally disabling, that he cannot now walk in excess of three miles at a time and that his injury has the potential to prevent him from walking at all in the future.

In other words, he says that, given that the 2008 and 2009 audiograms detected his slight hearing impairment, it is reasonable to assume that the impairment has existed since 1981 when the artillery round was detonated close to the trench in which he was situated, and that this initial injury was exacerbated by prolonged exposure to noise during his military service in the infantry and in the military band.", "036": "[36]\nThe Applicant believes that the Board either disregarded or failed to give sufficient consideration to this limited medical evidence because it considered his claim to be yet \"another example of the department's time being abused by the handling of negative reports.\" He personally believes that he carries his weight well enough and that it does not contribute to his disability.", "004": "[4]\nThe Applicant's hearing was tested prior to his joining the Regular Forces in 1976 and on a number of occasions prior to his retirement.

Canada (Attorney General)\n, [2000] 1 F.C. 647; 177 F.T.R. 5 (T.D.), shares similar facts with the instant case. That case was an application for judicial review of a Veterans Review and Appeal Board decision confirming earlier determinations that the applicant was not eligible for a disability pension under the\nPension Act\npursuant to paragraph 21(2)(a). The applicant was seriously injured when hit by a vehicle while crossing a road to return to the base where he was on duty, from the restaurant where he had eaten dinner because there was no mess on the base. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board found that there was an insufficient causal link between the applicant's military service and the injury to satisfy paragraph 21(2)(a). The Court carried out a pragmatic and functional analysis to determine the standard of review. As part of that analysis, Justice Evans distinguished the rights at stake as being \"not of the same order\" as those protected under ss. 7 and 15 of the\nCharter\n:\n\"33. Second, the nature of the rights determined by the Board is also relevant. Disability pensions are doubtless of great importance to the individuals concerned, but their denial is not normally likely to consign unsuccessful claimants to destitution, nor to preclude their pursuit of other remedies such as, in this case, a claim in tort against the owner of the vehicle that hit MWO McTague, or a statutory claim under the provincial motor vehicle compensation fund.\n\"34. In my opinion, the rights at stake here are not of the same order of importance as the right to be recognized as a refugee (\nPushpanathan\n, supra), or to be free from discrimination [page 664] (\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Mossop\n, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).

The provision merely states:\n\"14(1) On completion of an investigation, the chairman shall (a) refer the complaint to the council for a determination as to whether the proceeding should be discontinued.\"\nIt was therefore open to reviewing courts to refer, inter alia, to s. 14(1)(d), which makes the decision of an individual council member to dismiss or not to dismiss contingent on whether the complaint is\njustified\nor not (in other words, contingent on the merits of the case) in interpreting subsection 14(1)(a). This is exactly what the B.C. Supreme Court appears to have done in\nCook\n(pp. 61-62):\n\"When considering whether or not to discontinue proceedings under s. 14(1)(a), it is my view that the council must employ an objective standard. The one that comes readily to mind is that to which the common law has frequent resort, namely a standard which invokes a test of reasonableness. I conclude that when considering a complaint the council must determine whether there is any evidence upon which either a board of enquiry under s. 16 or a designated member of council under s. 14(1)(d), acting reasonably, could find the complaint to be proved on a balance of probabilities. If so, then it ought not to order proceedings discontinued under s. 14(1)(a), but, instead, it must move on to a consideration of the three remaining alternatives found in that subsection.\"", "045": "[45]\nThe investigator in\nS.E.P.Q.A.\nconcluded that although some discrepancies in pay levels existed they were attributable to job misclassification and were not significant, having regard to the overall consistency of the ratings. In light of these findings, the investigator recommended that the complaint be rejected by the CHRC as unsubstantiated.", "042": "[42]\nLatif\ninvolved the refusal of the CHRC to exercise jurisdiction over alleged discrimination that occurred against the complainant when he was dismissed by the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise. The incident took place prior to the coming into force of the\nAct\nand the CHRC hearing and application for judicial review took place prior to the amendment of ss. 18 and 28 of the\nFederal Court Act\n. It is also to be noted that the CHRC's decision not to deal with the complaint was justified on the ground that it appeared to be beyond its jurisdiction. Therefore, technically, the complaint was dismissed pursuant to s. 33 of the\nAct\n(now s. 41) as opposed to s. 36 (now s. 44). Nevertheless, the principles of judicial review enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal - that since the result of the decision involved a final determination of the complainant's rights, the complainant must be given the opportunity to be heard, even if merely in writing - are relevant to the case at bar.", "024": "[24]\nComplaint H30995 was filed pursuant to s. 7 of the\nAct\nand s. 13.1 of S.C. 1976-77 c. 33, as amended. In that complaint, the applicant alleged that discrimination due to age and sex occurred when her position was disestablished and she was forced to sign an education agreement in order to upgrade her skills. According to the applicant, this agreement required her to work harder than her male peers, removed from her the opportunity to keep current her knowledge of cryptanalysis and Signal Intelligence and adversely affected her pension and right to early retirement. In addition, she argued that the CSE did not respect the terms of the agreement and harassed her with respect to the agreement.", "019": "[19]\nFurthermore, pursuant to CSE policy, the applicant's security clearance to CSE premises was revoked during her education leave. Other employees in a similar position (i.e. on leave for more than three months) did not appear to have these privileges revoked. CSE attributed this discrepancy to an \"administrative oversight\".", "022": "[22]\nAfter the applicant was notified of the termination of the agreement and was ordered to return to work, she submitted a written complaint to the Deputy Minister of Defence. When the Deputy Minister decided to close his file on the matter, the Deputy Chief of the CSE sent two letters instructing the applicant to report to work on April 25, 1988 and May 2, 1988 respectively. On May 4, 1988, after the applicant did not show up at the CSE, the Deputy Chief sent her a letter, declaring her to have abandoned her position. Due to the nature of the termination of employment, the applicant was not entitled to severance pay and was only entitled to the return of her Public Service Superannuation fees.", "029": "[29]\nThe applicant went on to argue that the CSE had a practice of hiring ex-military men and younger men. The few women that were on CSE's payroll were, according to the applicant, victimized by a sex-segregated work environment where the jobs of women were perceived as less skilled and less important. The applicant submitted that military men were \"parachuted\" into higher positions, thereby blocking the normal progression of women into those positions.", "069": "[69]\nThe fact that the investigator did not interview each and every witness that the applicant would have liked her to and the fact that the conclusion reached by the investigator did not address each and every alleged incident of discrimination are not in and of themselves fatal as well. This is particularly the case where the applicant has the opportunity to fill in gaps left by the investigator in subsequent submissions of her own. In the absence of guiding regulations, the investigator, much like the CHRC, must be master of its own procedure, and judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation should only be warranted where the investigation is clearly deficient. In the case at bar I find that the investigator did not fail to address any fundamental aspect of the applicant's complaint, as it was worded, nor were any other, more minor but relevant points inadequately dealt with that could not be dealt with in the applicant's responding submissions.", "071": "[71]\nAssuming that a sufficiently thorough and neutral investigation is found to exist, the next step is for the CHRC to evaluate whether appointment of a tribunal is warranted, pursuant to s. 44(3) of the\nAct\n.", "057": "[57]\nIn contexts where parties have the legal right to make submissions in response to an investigator's report, such as in the case at bar, parties may be able to compensate for more minor omissions by bringing such omissions to the attention of the decision-maker. Therefore, it should be only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions that judicial review would be warranted. Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, it would seem to me that circumstances where further submissions cannot compensate for an investigator's omissions would include: (1) where the omission is of such a fundamental nature that merely drawing the decision maker's attention to the omission cannot compensate for it or (2) where fundamental evidence is inaccessible to the decision maker by virtue of the protected nature of the information or where the decision maker explicitly disregards it.", "067": "[67]\nAlthough the investigation appears to have only been conducted over a period of three days, it appears from the report that all of the fundamental issues contained in the applicant's complaint, including the section head's treatment of the applicant, were considered by the investigator. The fact that \"no analysis\" of certain specific allegations was contained in the written report of the investigator (the investigator's report only a summary of each side's story) or in the CHRC's reasons for dismissal of the complaint does not indicate that these allegations were not considered by the investigator and is by no means a ground for review. I find support for this conclusion in the fact that there is no general common law duty for administrative bodies to give reasons for their decisions, [See, inter alia,\nR. v. Gaming Board of Great Britain, ex parte Benaim\n, [1970] 2 All E.R. 528 (C.A.);\nGlendenning Motorways Inc. v. Royal Transportation Ltd.\n(1975), 59 D.L.R.(3d) 89 (Man. C.A.)] and by the fact that the\nAct\nis silent with regard to the necessity of written reasons, in contrast to s. 42(1), which applies to cases in which the Commission finds a complaint inadmissible on one of the grounds listed in s. 41. As Justice Pinard concluded in the case of\nMercier v. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\n(1991), 51 F.T.R. 205, at p. 213: \"... the absence of reason for the decision is no more a breach of procedural fairness than of the\nAct\n\".", "023": "[23]\nThe applicant attempted, on October 26, 1987, to initiate a complaint with the CHRC with regard to the events which gave rise to the complaints in the case at bar. The applicant only succeeded in filing the complaints with the CHRC on February 19, 1988 and October 6, 1989; these complaints were numbered H30995 and H31558 respectively. In the meanwhile, the applicant was told that the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB) was the appropriate forum for her case. PSSRB Hearings were held, although the applicant submits that she did not raise issue of discrimination with the PSSRB, as the CHRC was the appropriate forum for such issues. The PSSRB deliberated on the case for over 25 days, from November 30, 1988 to October 19, 1989 and rendered its decision on March 12, 1990. In this decision, it was held that the respondent acted in bad faith in dismissing the complainant, and that the respondent's actions were tantamount to de facto dismissal of the applicant. The applicant was granted two years of salary as damages as well as severance pay.", "014": "[14]\nThere is a difference of opinion as to whether the request for education leave was initiated by the applicant or by her employer; regardless, in the spring of 1986, both parties entered negotiations for an agreement for education leave for the applicant. During the period, the applicant requested, and obtained, special leave with pay, which, she submitted, was essential in light of the stress that she had been experiencing at the CSE. Although an agreement was apparently reached in August 1986 between the CSE and the solicitor who was acting on the applicant's behalf, the applicant refused to accept the terms of the agreement, and enrolled in courses of her own choosing at the University of Ottawa.", "083": "[83]\nIt is therefore not possible for the applicant to argue that the finding of the CHRC, that the applicant's allegation of discrimination is unfounded, is a finding of fact made in perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, pursuant to s. 18.1(4)(d) of the\nFederal Court Act\n.\nIII Conclusion", "044": "[44]\nFinally,\nS.E.P.Q.A.\ninvolved a complaint pursuant to the equal pay for work of equal value provisions of the\nAct\n(s. 11) against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In\nS.E.P.Q.A.\n, an investigator was appointed by the CHRC, who kept both parties informed of his progress throughout the approximately four year investigation. The study conducted by the investigator appears to have been thorough, involving testing the CBC's existing classification levels against classification levels identified by CHRC experts using first the former CBC plan and then a treasury Board plan, called the Aitken Plan.", "005": "[5]\nThe applicant filed a number of complaints of discrimination with the CHRC. The first complaint (1982) was apparently not accepted by the CHRC in order to maintain the security of the CSE. The second (1985), which pertained to a training film used at the CSE entitled \"The Human Touch Performance Appraisal\", was examined by the CHRC. On August 25, 1986, the CHRC sent a letter to the CSE, advising, inter alia, that \"the video portrays women negatively while men are seen as competent and adept at managing\". While the CHRC recommended that the film was not an appropriate tool to use for training, it held that \"it would be difficult to determine whether there is reasonable ground to believe the use of this video is discriminatory\".", "076": "[76]\nOn the other hand, the submission of the applicant, that judicial review of the exercise of discretion is warranted or CHRC dismissals of complaints each time that, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the complainant took his [or her] case out of the realm of conjecture, goes too far the other way. Counsel for the applicant brought to my attention the case of\nOnischak v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights)\n(1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D/6290 (B.C.S.C.), in support this submission. The\nOnischak\n, Huddart, J., relied on the test set out by Woods, J., in the case of\nCook v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights)\n(1988), 26 B.C.L.R.(2d) 52 (S.C.), in dismissing a complaint of discrimination based on alleged refusal to consider the complainant for a job as a probation officer due to the fact that he was visually impaired and did not hold a valid driver's licence. According to Huddart, J. (at D/6293):\n\"In view of the provisions of s. 12, any review of the question as to whether or not an investigation had been 'completed' necessarily involves an examination of the exercise of the council's discretion. The legislature has entrusted the responsibility to deal with human rights to the council, a specialized body, uniquely qualified to make the assessment as to whether to discontinue proceedings, recommend a settlement, submit a report to the minister or designate one of its members to hear written or oral submissions, as that member specifies, after an inquiry of whatever nature and extent it determines to be appropriate to the circumstances. In these circumstances the only question is whether or not the council acted patently unreasonably in exercising it discretion.\n\"What is patently unreasonable will depend on the circumstances of each case. The evidence uncovered by the investigation was insufficient to raise the inference of discrimination based on physical disability. Evidence was obtained that the decision to disqualify Mr. Onischak from the employment competition was based solely on facts unrelated to physical disability. In these circumstances it was not patently unreasonable for the council to conclude the investigation and order that the proceedings be discontinued without further inquiry and further response to the complainant.\"", "026": "[26]\nOn May 2, 1988, the CHRC appointed a Human Rights Officer to investigate the merits of the first complaint. This officer was replaced by Lisa Quiring on September 28, 1990, who investigated both complaints. Most investigatory activity appears to have been conducted within a period of three days (October 30th to November 1st), and the applicant complained that a number of people on the list that she submitted to the investigator as witness on her behalf were not interviewed or were only partially interviewed. In her report, dated December 13, 1991, Ms. Quiring recommended that each of the complaints be dismissed, as the allegations of discrimination could not be founded on the evidence.", "055": "[55]\nIn determining the degree of thoroughness of investigation required to be in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness, one must be mindful of the interests that are being balanced: the complainant's and respondent's interests in procedural fairness and the CHRC's interests in maintaining a workable and administratively effective system. Indeed, the following words from Mr. Justice Tarnopolsky's treatise\nDiscrimination and the Law\n(Don Mills: De Boo, 1985) at p. 131 seem to be equally applicable with regard to the determination of the requisite thoroughness of investigation:\n\"With the crushing case loads facing Commissions, and with the increasing complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in many of the complaints, it would be an administrative nightmare to hold a full hearing before dismissing any complaint which the investigation has indicated is unfounded. On the other hand, Commission should not be assessing credibility in making these decisions, and they must be conscious of the simple fact that the dismissal of most complaints cuts off all avenues of legal redress for the harm which the person alleges.\"", "021": "[21]\nIt was apparently the practice of the applicant to \"carry-over\" her vacation leave, without objection by the CSE. On May 12, 1987, however, the Deputy Chief wrote to the applicant that she would not be allowed to \"carry-over\" her accrued 36 days of leave and advised her to schedule leave time or he would do so on her behalf. The applicant's lawyer responded to this notice on June 4, 1987, referring to her unchallenged tradition of \"carry-over\". The Deputy Chief replied that he was authorized to deny carry-over for all managers according to the collective agreement. While this conflict was in process, on May 28, 1987, the Deputy Chief circulated a memo informing all managers that this policy was going to be strictly enforced.", "075": "[75]\nI cannot agree that s. 44(3) of the\nAct\nallows the CHRC to completely divorce such decisions from the merits of the complaint. If purely administrative considerations (i.e., cost, time) were allowed to prevail it is conceivable that a person's entitlement to relief under human rights legislation would be dependent on the ease of proving human rights violations. Such an approach is clearly inconsistent with the justice-based purpose of the\nAct\n, stated in s. 2, to give effect to the principle of equal opportunity. There exists ample authority in Canadian law that administrative agencies must, in exercising discretionary power, pursue purposes that in no way offends the spirit of the enabling statute (See\nMulti-Malls Inc. v. Ontario (Minister of Transport and Communications)\n(1976), 73 D.L.R.(3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.);\nPadfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\n, [1968] 1 All E.R. 694 (H.L.); general discussion in Dussault & Borgeat,\nAdministrative Law\n(Toronto: Carswell, 1990), at p. 340 ff.)", "032": "[32]\nWith respect to proof of discrimination, the applicant submitted that there was \"more than enough evidence to convince a reasonable commission that on a balance of probabilities there is enough evidence to proceed to the next stage.\" This was particularly so in the case at bar given that the nature of the discrimination that she alleged to have encountered at the CSE was particularly difficult to prove. Regarding the difficulty in proving discrimination, notably systemic discrimination, she cited the following passage from Mendez:\n\"Discrimination is but rarely overt. One is more likely to find cases in which the discriminatory element is dissimulated, than vice-versa. For example, rather than admit that they refuse to hire or promote blacks or women, respondents might pretend that the candidates lack the necessary qualifications or experience for the job, that they show signs of having a difficult personality and an inability to get along with colleagues etc.\" (Mendez,\nPresumptions of Discriminatory Motive in Title VII Disparate Treatment Cases\n(1980), 32 Stan.

The applicant submitted to the CHRC that she provided the CSE with \"information\" on the program she was taking as well as a course calendar on October 3, 1986. She claimed that she chose not to communicate the requested information because she perceived that the CSE had no intention of honouring the agreement.", "015": "[15]\nAn agreement was actually finalized between the parties on February 26, 1987.

Subsequent to completion of the leave, the applicant was to continue her employment with CSE until at least 1994;\n4. The applicant was to register as a full-time student and take 11 identified courses.

The CSE was free to terminate the agreement if, based on the applicant's marks and the opinion of the university, she would not be able to complete her course of study within the allotted four years. No reimbursement was due if the leave was terminated; and\n6. Upon successful completion of the leave, the applicant was free to return to the CSE at CO-4 level.", "010": "[10]\nWhen these allegations were investigated by the CHRC, it was found that the appellant had in fact received some recognition for her work in the form of letters of appreciation from the former chief of the CSE in 1978 and from the Director General of Administration in 1981.", "063": "[63]\nThe applicant also emphasized to the CHRC and to this court that because of the secrecy surrounding CSE, she felt that there were serious limitations concerning the information that she could disclose prior to the formal appointment of a tribunal and that only a human rights tribunal could obtain access to certain classified information which would support her allegations. The applicant has simply failed to convince me on either of these arguments.", "079": "[79]\nIn light of the fact that the power vested with the CHRC under s. 44(3) is discretionary in nature, I must accept the following guiding statement of McIntyre, J., in\nMaple Lodge Farms v.

Although the wording of the statement was unfortunate, it certainly does not give rise to a reviewable error.", "008": "[8]\nOver the subsequent years, several incidents of turbulence occurred between the applicant and her peers at the CSE. During an interview, Mr. Johnston described a \"pattern of resistance that he continues to encounter from E. Slattery - constant questioning of his decisions ...\". The applicant, for her part, perceived that her authority was being undermined by Mr. Johnston and that there was a general lack of respect for her as an individual and for her position. In particular, it appears from the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant that she was denied crypt training in England on three separate occasions in 1981, 1982 and 1983. The explanation given for this refusal was that the training was of a \"basic\" nature and that as a Unit Head, she was not entitled to it.", "061": "[61]\nCan it be said that sufficient thoroughness existed in the case at bar and, if not, that the omissions in the investigator's report could be corrected by the applicant's responding submission?", "035": "[35]\nThe material referred to by the Commission in reaching its decision is listed in the affidavit of Lucie Veillette, Secretary to the CHRC.

In making its decision to dismiss the complaint without a tribunal hearing:\n\"The [CHRC] was entitled to consider the investigator's report, such other underlying material as it, in its discretion, considered necessary and the representations of the parties.

As stated by Professor Wade:\n\"Questions of law must be distinguished from questions of fact, but this has been one of the situations where the rules have taken different forms under judicial manipulation ...\n\"The simpler and more logical doctrine has been recognized in many judgments. This is that matters of facts are the primary facts of the particular case which have to be established before the law can be applied, the 'facts which are observed by the witnesses and proved by testimony', to which should be added any facts of common knowledge of which the court will take notice without proof. Whether these facts, once established, satisfy some legal definition or requirement must be a question of law, for the question then is how to interpret and apply the law to those established facts.\" (Wade,\nAdministrative Law\n, (6th Ed.

Rather, a general duty of \"procedural fairness\" is to be applied to all administrative decision-making processes, the context of which varies according to the circumstances of the particular instance. In the words of LaForest, J., in\nS.E.P.Q.A. v.

The distinction between them therefore becomes blurred as one approaches the lower end of the scale of judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals and the high end of the scale with respect to administrative or executive tribunals. Accordingly, the content of the rules to be followed by a tribunal is now not determined by attempting to classify them as judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative or executive.

The investigator's reports were not received by the complainant until after the final decision had been made by the CHRC. Lamer, J., (as he then was), held that procedural fairness requires that the complainant be provided with an opportunity to make submissions, at least in writing, before any action is taken on the basis of an investigator's report and, in particular, in order to ensure that such submissions are made on an informed basis, the CHRC must, prior to its decision, disclose the substance of the case against the complainant.", "020": "[20]\nThe applicant was also apparently sent notice, during her leave, by CSE's Security Officer, that her belongings at the CSE would have to be vacated due to space constraints. As no response was received from the applicant, the possessions in question were packed and itemized and numerous attempts were made to contact the applicant to arrange for their delivery. They were then sent to the applicant's home on or after June 18, 1987. According to the applicant, she was never contacted about the removal of her belongings and was \"devastated\" to find them in her driveway.", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant was an employee of the Communications Security Establishment Division of the Department of National Defence (\"CSE\") from 1956 until she was dismissed on May 4, 1988.

However, underlying these requirements is the assumption that another aspect of procedural fairness - that the CHRC had an adequate and fair basis on which to evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant appointment of a tribunal - existed.", "053": "[53]\nThe requirement of thoroughness of investigation stems from the essential role that investigators play in determining the merits of particular complaints. This essential role was recognized by the Supreme Court in the\nS.E.P.Q.A.\ncase. In the words of Sopinka, J.:\n\"In general, complainants look to the Commission to lead evidence before a tribunal appointed under [s. 49], and therefore investigation of the complaint is essential if the [CHRC] is to carry out this role.\" (\nS.E.P.Q.A.\n, at p. 898)", "049": "[49]\nIn order for a fair basis to exist of the CHRC to evaluate whether a tribunal should be appointed pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the\nAct\n, I believe that the investigation conducted prior to this decision must satisfy at least two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness.", "011": "[11]\nPrior to 1982, the appraisals that the applicant received from her supervisors for her work were \"outstanding\", \"very good\", etc; however, from 1982 to 1984, these appraisals deteriorated from \"fully meets requirements\" to \"meets minimum requirements\". After receiving the latter evaluation, the applicant entered Mr. Johnston's office with a union official, demanded to discuss the appraisal. Mr. Johnston admitted telling the applicant that such incidents are not conducive to a good working relationship and suggested that she find a job elsewhere in the CSE.", "034": "[34]\nThe CHRC's decision to dismiss both of the applicant's complaints without proceeding to a request for a full tribunal hearing was dated February 21, 1992 and reads as follows:\n\"Dear Ms. Slattery:\nThe Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the investigation report of your complaints (H30995) and (H31558) against Department of National Defence dated February 19, 1988 and October 6, 1989 respectively, alleging discrimination in employment on the grounds of age and sex. The Commission also reviewed the submission dated February 6, 1992, signed by Lucie Lalibert\u00e9.\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)(b)(i) of the\nCanadian Human Rights Act\n, to dismiss the complaints because on the evidence the allegation of discrimination is unfounded.\nAs the Commission's decision is final, we have closed our files on these complaints.\"", "073": "[73]\nMust such a link exist under the current\nAct\n, where a CHRC finding that \"inquiry is\nwarranted\n\" is the applicable standard as opposed to \"complaints being substantiated\"?", "062": "[62]\nI note in the first place that complaints H30995 and H31558 were both framed exclusively in terms of alleged discrimination suffered by the applicant personally. Nowhere in the particulars of either complaint were allegations made regarding systemic discrimination or unequal pay for work of equal value at CSE generally. Indeed, much of the concern over the systemic nature of discrimination at the CSE only appeared in the applicant's responding submission, which was prepared by Ms. Lalibert\u00e9 and submitted on February 6, 1992. As such, I cannot characterize such evidence as \"fundamental\" to the applicant's complaints.", "009": "[9]\nThe applicant also believes that she did not receive due recognition for her efforts in promoting equality. In particular, Ms. Patricia Badiet was named Affirmative Action Coordinator of CSE despite the applicant being the woman with the most union training. In addition, the applicant was not included as a member of the planning group for a woman's issues conference which was held on October 22, 1985 and was organized by a committee headed by Ms. Badiet. Furthermore, in a questionnaire circulated by Ms. Badiet in May 1985, no reference was made to the prior work of the applicant. In the words of the applicant, \"she [Ms. Badiet] seemed to be excluding my work by setting the clock back to 1976\".", "012": "[12]\nThe specific events which give rise to the complaints in the case at bar stem from a reorganization of the applicant's work group that was undertaken in 1984. In 1985, the applicant's job was disestablished when the functions of her unit, 01B, were merged with another unit, M4B10, (the latter apparently being part of the \"M\" group) The applicant's position was most seriously affected by this reorganization, since she was the only member of her unit who was not offered an transfer to the \"M\" group, which was apparently given jurisdiction for cryptanalysis. According to the applicant, her position was disestablished because Mr. Johnston wanted to get rid of her. The explanation offered by the CSE is entirely different. According to the submission made to the CHRC by S.P. Hunter, the Human Rights Coordinator of the Department of National Defence, during this same period, a Cray computer was obtained for the \"M\" group, for which special knowledge in mathematics and computer science was required. The applicant did not have a degree or the mathematics skills to operate the Cray computer.", "059": "[59]\nI also find support for the above approach in the holding of the Supreme Court of Canada in\nUniversit\u00e9 du Quebec \u00e0 Trois-Riv\u00e8res v. Larocque\n(1993), 148 N.R. 209; 93 C.L.L.C. 12,104 (S.C.C.).\nLarocque\ninvolved judicial review of a decision of an arbitrator to allow an objection against the admission of evidence. The evidence in question in\nLarocque\nwould have substantiated the univeristy's claim that a shortage of funds, which was blamed for the termination of two research assistants, was attributable to the work of the assistants themselves. With such evidence, it could have been possible to justify the termination as attributable to a cause within the employee's control. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision of the Quebec Superior Court to review the arbitrator's decision to permit an objection to admitting the evidence. In his reasons for decisions, Lamer, C.J., stressed that the arbitrator did not necessarily violate the principles of natural justice by erroneously excluding relevant evidence; however where such evidence is significant to the outcome of the case (i.e., in this sense it is fundamental), review would be warranted. In the words of the Chief Justice (at p. 111):\n\"A grievance arbitrator is in the privileged position to assess the relevance of evidence presented to him and I do not think it is desirable for the courts, in the guise of protecting the right of parties to be heard, to substitute their own assessment of the evidence for that of the grievance arbitrator. It may happen, however, that the rejection of relevant evidence has such an impact on the fairness of the proceeding, leading unavoidably to the conclusion that there has been a breach of natural justice.\"", "028": "[28]\nThe applicant made it clear from the outset in her response that she was not satisfied with the manner in which the investigation had been conducted. In the words of the applicant:\n\"It would appear that the investigation was very narrowly focused on isolated incidents rather than dealing with the context which brought about the signing of the agreement and in which allegations of abandonment of position were made. These events are merely the conclusion to a very long-standing problem at CSE. The issue to be determined is not only whether these events were discriminatory in and of themselves but also whether or not they were precipitated by previous discrimination on the part of the employer.\"", "068": "[68]\nThe rules of the procedural fairness require merely that a complainant know the essence of the case against him or her. In the words of Lord Denning in the case of\nSelvarajan v. Race Relations Board\n, [1976] 1 All E.R. 12, at p. 19 (C.A.), cited by Justice Sopinka in\nS.E.P.Q.A.\n(p. 900):\n\"The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subjected to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some such way adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be told of the case made against him and be afforded a fair opportunity of answering it. The investigating body is, however, master of its own procedure. It need not hold a hearing. It can do everything in writing. It need not allow lawyers. It need not put every detail of the case against a man. Suffice it if the broad grounds are given.\"\nThe investigator's conclusion in the case at bar stated that:\n\"The evidence shows that the complainant's position was disestablished due to a reorganization, and that she refused two offers for positions at her CO-4 level because she wanted to continue working in cryptanalysis, she signed an education leave agreement. There was a dispute over the terms and conditions of the agreement, and the complainant was instructed by the respondent to return to work. When the complainant refused to do so, her employment was terminated.\n\"There is no evidence that the complainant was treated differently or harassed because of her age and sex.\n\"It is therefore recommended that the Commission dismiss the complaint because on the evidence the allegation of discrimination is unfounded.\"\nThe CHRC's adoption of that conclusion was more than sufficient to provide the applicant with the \"broad grounds\" of the case against her, given the detailed description of the evidence of the case that was contained in the report.", "030": "[30]\nIt was also submitted by the applicant that professional segregation existed between the 01A (predominantly male) and 01B groups (predominantly female), as 01B jobs were undervalued. The unit head of group 01B was a CO4 and the workers were CO3's. Meanwhile, the unit head of 01A was a CO5 while the workers were CO4's. As such, the job classification scheme at the CSE was discriminatory and expert evidence would be necessary to identify the bias at the CSE, which, by its nature, was insidious.", "060": "[60]\nOne can infer that in the\nS.E.P.Q.A.\ncase, the Supreme Court was satisfied with the thoroughness of the investigation and the level of interaction between the investigator and the parties during the investigation.

On or about September 7, 2000, counsel for Unique wrote to the Commission, requesting that the Commission exercise its discretion not to deal with the complaint on the basis of section 41 of the\nCanadian Human Rights Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \"\nAct\n\"). The Respondent raised the issue of the timeliness of the Applicant's complaint and the prejudice that it would suffer if required to respond with allegations relating to an alleged act of discrimination that had occurred in 1997.", "008": "[8]\nThe Applicant did contact the Ontario Human Rights Commission and by letter dated January 6, 2000, was advised that the complaint may more appropriately be dealt with by the Canadian Human Rights Commission since it related to a federally regulated corporation.", "035": "[35]\nThe issue arising in this case is whether the Commission committed a reviewable error in making its decision. This leads to consideration of the applicable standard of review. In\nCape Breton Development Corp.\n, supra, the Court characterized a decision made under section 41(1)(e) of the\nAct\nas a discretionary administrative decision and said as follows at paragraph 15:\n\"It is well settled, as all parties agree, that decisions of the Commission under paragraph 41(e) are discretionary administrative decisions. Decisions of that nature are not readily set aside, and courts will not interfere, even if they might have exercised the discretion differently, where the discretion has been exercised in good faith, in accord with the principle of natural justice and procedural fairness, and where reliance has not been placed on considerations that are irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose.\" (Footnotes omitted)", "047": "[47]\nIn the present case, the Respondent raised no new matters in its reply submissions. The question of the timeliness of the Applicant's complaint was always an issue, whether or not it was raised by the Respondent. The\nAct\nprovides that a complaint concerning alleged discrimination on a prohibited ground is to be filed within twelve months of the event in question, unless the Commission in its discretion decides otherwise. This limitation is provided in section 41(1)(e). The Applicant knew, or ought to have known, that she was to file her complaint within one year of the alleged discriminatory act. She was in control of initiating a complaint and she characterized the Respondent's refusal to hire Mr. Love in June 1997, as a junior driver on her truck, as a discriminatory act based on sex, that is her status as a female owner of a truck.", "013": "[13]\nBy a further undated letter received by counsel for the Respondent on or about January 15, 2001, the Commission forwarded a copy of the Investigation Report. The Report recommended that the Commission not deal with the complaint. The Respondent was given the opportunity to comment on the Report if it wished to do so.", "039": "[39]\nThere is no privative clause in the\nAct\n. The purpose that a section 41(1) decision plays in the entire legislative scheme must be kept in mind, that is to act as a screening function, to prevent claims that, for various, enumerated reasons, should not be permitted to go forward. The nature of the decision under review points to a more deferential standard of review.", "006": "[6]\nThe Applicant initially contacted the Commission by telephone on or about October 24, 1998. She requested the materials necessary to file a complaint. She received the materials on or about November 12, 1998 and returned the completed forms on or about November 27, 1998. In April 1999, the Applicant received a response from the Commission, advising that it could not assist her. The text of that letter provides, in part, as follows:\n\"Thank you for your letter of November 27, 1998, alleging that you have been discriminated against by Concord Transport and indicating that you wish to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\nI have carefully reviewed your correspondence and must advise you that the Commission cannot offer you assistance in this matter. Under the\nCanadian Human Rights Act\n, the Commission investigates allegations of discrimination in employment and in the provision of services in federal areas, on the following grounds: disability, age, religion, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status and pardoned conviction. Individuals such as yourself may find themselves subject to what they believe to be unfair treatment. However, unless that treatment is related to one of the grounds listed above, it would not constitute discrimination under our\nAct\n.\nThank you for advising us of your concerns. I regret that my response cannot be more positive.\"", "043": "[43]\nThe key factor in the Commission's decision here is its finding that the alleged discriminatory act occurred in June 1997 and not at some later date as suggested by the Applicant. The Applicant argues that she was not aware of the subsequent hiring of Mr. Love by the Respondent until May 1998. She also suggests that the date of the alleged discrimination was August 1997 when she signed the contract with the Respondent for the employment of her truck with one driver.", "020": "[20]\nThe Applicant argues that the Commission must comply with the rules of procedural fairness in carrying out an investigation and considering the complaint pursuant to section 44 of the\nAct\n. She says that the Commission failed to inquire into all the relevant circumstances in her case, and this failure amounts to an error affecting the jurisdiction of the Commission: see\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Boone\n(1993), 60 F.T.R. 142 (T.D.).", "002": "[2]\nThe Applicant, at the material times, owned a transport truck. She hired drivers to operate her truck as she did not drive it herself. Mr. Steve Love was hired by the Applicant in May 1996, as a junior driver. The Applicant provided driver's training to Mr. Love and employed him as part of a team with Mr. Allan Kent, a senior driver.", "048": "[48]\nIf this refusal was indeed an act of discrimination on the basis of sex, it occurred in June 1997 and not at a later date when Mr. Love was hired by the Respondent, independent of any employment relationship between Mr. Love and the Applicant. The Commission did not address the merits of the Applicant's complaint. In light of its finding on the timeliness of that complaint, it was unnecessary to go into its merits. In dealing with the preliminary issue of timeliness, the Commission was complying with its obligation to decide whether a complaint should be subject to further action, that is an inquiry.", "049": "[49]\nIn the facts of the present case, where the issue of timeliness was apparent on the face of the Applicant's complaint, the Commission did not breach the duty of procedural fairness by disclosing the Applicant's submissions on the Investigation Report to the Respondent without providing the Applicant with the Respondent's reply.", "011": "[11]\nThe Respondent received an undated letter from Mr. Pierre Boileau, Manager, Complaints and Investigation with the Commission on September 25, 2000 informing it that an investigator had been named to investigate the Applicant's complaint. Mr. Boileau advised that although the alleged discriminatory act had occurred more than one year before the Commission received the complaint, the Commission intended to proceed with the complaint. However, the Respondent was invited to make submissions on the issue of prejudice.", "034": "[34]\nThe Commission decided not to further deal with the complaint, pursuant to section 41(1)(e) of the\nAct\n. It stated two reasons for its decision: first, the delay by the Applicant in filing her complaint and second, the prejudice resulting to the Respondent due to lack of documentation and possible impairment of witnesses' memories.", "009": "[9]\nThe Applicant then contacted her local member of Parliament for assistance in dealing with the Commission. On or about March 24, 2000, the Applicant received a complaint form from the Commission. She returned that form on or about March 29, 2000. She received more complaint forms from the Commission and returned the final completed form on or about May 24.", "012": "[12]\nThe Respondent replied to this letter by letter dated November 6, 2000 and provided answers to the specific questions raised in the correspondence from the Commission. The Respondent repeated its position that allowing the complaint to proceed would be prejudicial to it. Among other things, it stated that some witnesses were unavailable since the persons involved in the interview with the Applicant and Mr. Love were no longer employed by the Respondent. Furthermore, the Respondent said that it would be prejudiced if required to investigate an event that had occurred more than three years before:\n\"Question: Are witnesses still available? If not, why?\nAnswer: No. The employees who were involved in the decision to hire Steve Love are no longer employed by Concord Transportation Inc.\nQuestion: What efforts have been made to find witnesses?\nAnswer: Efforts have not been made to find these former employees to date.\nQuestion: What harm could be caused by the delay? Explain in details.\nAnswer: We reiterate on behalf of our client that to allow the Complaint to proceed at this stage would require our client to launch an investigation to look into allegations relating to incidents that occurred more than three years ago. Our client cannot help but be prejudiced by the Complainants' delay in filing the Complaint.\nYou have also asked for additional information concerning the merits of Ms. Price's Complaint. Our client relies on the particulars set out in our firm's correspondence dated September 7, 2000, in addition to the documentary evidence already provided to the Commission. We advise that Concord Transportation Inc. does not have specific policies addressing the composition of driving teams and, in particular, whether team members of opposite sex are allowed. We reiterate, however, that our client currently engages three female owner/operators and approximately eighteen (18) husband and wife owner/operator teams. Our client also employs female drivers through Unique Personnel Services Inc., a placement agency. ...\"", "028": "[28]\nThe Respondent submits that the decision of the Commission is reasonably supported by the evidence and was made in accordance with the principles of natural justice, including procedural fairness, and that this application should be dismissed.

I explained to the applicant that even if he was the most qualified person in his field, it would not be possible for me to approve his application if there was no demand in Canada for someone with these skills and experience. During the interview, I gave the applicant the opportunity to discuss at length the duties he had performed and the responsibilities he had assumed with his current and previous employers. At the conclusion of the interview, I advised the applicant that I would review his application upon return to New Delhi to determine if there is a demand in Canada for persons with his skills and experience.\n\"12. On August 30, 1994, I reviewed the information contained in the documents provided by the applicant and the information provided by the Applicant during the interview, in relation to various occupational categories contained in the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations.

He has worked in only two organizations in the twenty-three years since he entered the labour market. Although he moved ahead within the organizations, it is always in the context of a similar type of work.\"\nWith regard to the comment, while breadth of experience is clearly a factor to be considered by those assessing applications for permanent residence in Canada, it would seem unfortunate if dedication to a particular employer resulting in progress through the ranks in employment over a considerable number of years with the same employer and depth rather than breadth of experience were assessed negatively.", "008": "[8]\nWhatever the merits, counsel for the applicant argued that the respondent was simply too late in raising this matter having himself filed the defendant's affidavit in reply after the filing of the application for judicial review and the impugned affidavit.

Counsel for the applicant correctly pointed out rule 302(c) of the\nFederal Court Rules\n, and I am in agreement that the above matters should have been raised much earlier than now. The respondent had ample time prior to the hearing to address the issues raised in his motions. Rule 302(c) reads:\n'302. The following provisions apply with reference to formal objections and failures to comply with the requirements of these rules: ...'\n(c) no application to set aside any proceeding for irregularity shall be allowed unless made within a reasonable time, nor if the party applying has taken any fresh step after knowledge of the irregularity;'\"\nBy contrast, in this matter, on an application on behalf of the applicant for an order extending the time in which the applicant would be allowed to file his supplementary application record and allowing the applicant to file a further affidavit to support his application as part of the supplementary application record, Rothstein J., on the 4th day of April 1995, denied the motion and stated:\n\"The filing of material on behalf of the applicant (presumably the supporting affidavit here impugned) was by counsel who should be familiar with the\nRules of Court\n.\n\"The argument as to the propriety or otherwise of the affidavit in question will be argued before the judicial review judge.\"\nClearly Rothstein, J., contemplated the preliminary consideration which came before me and did not regard it as a matter that should have been disposed of in advance of the judicial review hearing.

Where his work experience suggests that the occupation may be appropriate, the visa officer must assess the applicant in the designated occupation, regardless of which alternate occupations the officer has seen fit to consider.\"\nThe visa officer here clearly assessed the applicant against alternate occupations. For reasons stated in his affidavit and underlined for emphasis in paragraph 12 quoted above, the applicant was not assessed against the occupation of production co-ordinator, his preferred occupation if he were permitted to immigrate to Canada, because \"... he has not been involved with co-ordinating work between different units but was rather supervising the work within the single production unit\".", "009": "[9]\nIn the result, I struck paragraph 6 and exhibit E from the affidavit in support of the applicant's application for judicial review and proceeded to consider the merits of the application on the basis of the material remaining before the court.", "012": "[12]\nIn guidance to those such as the visa officer in this matter who are required to use the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (\"CCDO\") in assessing applications for landed immigrant status, the following is provided:\n\"(4)\nThe Lead Statement\n(of an occupation description) is a concise description of the nature and purpose of the occupation. It describes the principal duties of the worker, and gives a general indication of how the occupation differs from other occupations.\n\"(5)\nThe Statement of Duties\nis necessarily a broad description of the nature and scope of the work involved. This description will not always coincide exactly with the duties required in every job situation, but it does indicate, either directly or by inference, what the workers normally do, how, and why they do it.\"\nThe description \"Production Co-ordinator (clerical); production expediter; production scheduler\", reads as follows:\n\"Co-ordinates and expedites flow of work\nwithin\nor between departments of manufacturing plant according to production schedule:\nReviews production schedule and work orders and reschedules processes to eliminate duplicate machine setups. Distributes work orders to departments denoting number, type and proposed completion date of units to be produced.

Compiles reports on progress of work and machine, tool and equipment failures, using typewriter, to inform production planning department of production delays. Informs department supervisor of changes in processing methods received from engineering departments.\"\nHaving turned to the CCDO for guidance in this matter, the visa officer was obliged to take the whole of the occupation description into account and to interpret it appropriately. Here, the lead statement of the occupation description clearly indicates that a production co-ordinator may co-ordinate and expedite flow of work\nwithin\na department of a manufacturing plant even though the statement of duties that follows seems to reflect an interdepartmental co-ordination which is only partially consistent with the lead statement. The visa officer rejected consideration of the applicant against the occupational description because the applicant had not been involved with co-ordinating work between \"... different units but was rather supervising the work within a single production unit\". In so concluding, I am satisfied that the visa officer misinterpreted the occupation description on the facts of the applicant's situation and in so doing erred in law.", "004": "[4]\nCounsel for the respondent sought to strike the applicant's affidavit as improper and, in consequence, to strike the application for judicial review as being unsupported by an affidavit verifying the facts relied on by the applicant (see\nFederal Court Rule\n1603(1)).

The reliability of paragraph 6, based on exhibit E, is clearly brought into question by the divergencies between the substance of exhibit E, the applicant's recollections of his interview with the visa officer, and the substance of the affidavit of the visa officer, filed by the respondent, which is clearly based on the visa officer's personal knowledge."}, "decision": "a visa officer must interpret the CCDO correctly and if he misinterprets it, his decision is liable to be set aside."}, "489": {"paragraphs": {"027": "[27]\nFinally, I must consider whether the Refugee Division made this erroneous finding of fact \"without regard for the material before it\". In my view, the evidence was so important to the applicant's case that it can be inferred from the Refugee Division's failure to mention it in its reasons that the finding of fact was made without regard to it. This inference is made easier to draw because the Board's reasons dealt with other items of evidence indicating that a return would not be unduly harsh. The inclusion of the \"boilerplate\" assertion that the Board considered all the evidence before it is not sufficient to prevent this inference from being drawn, given the importance of the evidence to the applicant's claim.", "018": "[18]\nThe first question therefore, to be determined, is whether the Board erred in finding that, on the balance of probabilities, there was no serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted in Mexico outside Mexico City. The Refugee Division took the view that, on the evidence before it, the threats facing the applicant were strictly local in nature, and that once outside the jurisdiction of the federal judicial police the applicant had no reason to fear that he or his family would be subject to further violence as a result of his union activity and other forms of resistance to the demands of corrupt officials.", "024": "[24]\nIn her evidence, which was unchallenged, Dr. Pilowsky described the applicant's symptoms and concluded that:\n\"In my clinical opinion, having reviewed the clinical data emanating from the interview and after analysing the scores from the testing materials, Mr. Cepeda is currently suffering from symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ... This client was likely suffering the full blown PTSD while living in Mexico but it appears that some of his symptoms, such as his nightmares, are abating in Canada.\n\"This client's PTSD condition is a direct result of his traumatic experiences in Mexico as he reported no prior history of psychological problems. ...\n\"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is a condition highly susceptible to intensification and reinvigoration of symptoms if the sufferer is exposed to triggering stimuli reminiscent of the original trauma. Consequently, it is my professional opinion that if Mr. Cepeda were made to return to Mexico, the site of the traumatizing stressor, he would become retraumatized and his psychological condition would worsen.\n\"If the client is allowed to remain in Canada, the chances for recovery are more promising particularly once the anxiety of his hearing vanishes.\"", "019": "[19]\nThe Board based this conclusion on the following evidence. First, it noted that the taxi industry was subject to the authority of local government officials, who had been the source of the applicant's difficulties, and that consequently, when outside their jurisdiction, the applicant had nothing to fear. However, this finding may be somewhat questionable in light of evidence before the Board, which was not contradicted, that central government officials, through the governing party, the PRI, exercise considerable influence on matters that are formally within municipal control: the web of corruption that blights sectors of public life in Mexico does not respect the legal divisions of power between the different levels of government.", "022": "[22]\nNonetheless, although I doubt whether I would have reached the same conclusion as the Refugee Division on this issue, on the basis of the evidence as a whole I am not persuaded by the applicant that the Board clearly erred when it found that on the balance of probabilities the applicant faced no serious possibility of persecution outside Mexico City and, perhaps, other cities, like Toluca, within the surrounding state of Mexico. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider whether the Board's finding was \"without regard to the evidence\".\n2. Unreasonable To Expect The Applicant To Relocate In Mexico", "029": "[29]\nAccordingly, the decision dismissing the applicants' claims to be recognized as Convention refugees is set aside, and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Refugee Division to determine according to law, and in the light of these reasons, whether they are Convention refugees within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the\nImmigration Act\n.\nApplication allowed.", "023": "[23]\nThe applicant also attacked the Board's finding that it would not be unduly harsh to expect the applicant to relocate himself and his family in another part of Mexico. Counsel for the Minister forcefully drew to my attention cases in which it had been held that it is not unreasonable to require a person to live in a part of her country of citizenship where she has no friends or family, the climate might be less favourable, or a different type of employment would have to be sought: see, for example,\nThirunavukkarasu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n(1993), 163 N.R. 232 (F.C.A.), at pp. 236-237. But I did not understand counsel to maintain that it would be reasonable for a person to be required to return to a country, despite the serious adverse effect that this would have upon the person's psychological well-being, such as the persistence of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Rather, the dispute was whether on the totality of the evidence adduced in this case the Refugee Division had made an erroneous finding of fact \"without regard for the material before it\".", "014": "[14]\nIt is well established that s. 18.1(4)(d) of the\nFederal Court Act\ndoes not authorize the court to substitute its view of the facts for that of the Board, which has the benefit not only of seeing and hearing the witnesses, but also of the expertise of its members in assessing evidence relating to facts that are within their area of specialized expertise. In addition, and more generally, considerations of the efficient allocation of decision-making resources between administrative agencies and the courts strongly indicate that the role to be played in fact-finding by the court on an application for judicial review should be merely residual. Thus, in order to attract judicial intervention under s. 18.1(4)(d), the applicant must satisfy the court, not only that the Board made a palpably erroneous finding of material fact, but also that the finding was made \"without regard to the evidence\": see, for example,\nRajapakse v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n, [1993] F.C.J. No. 649 (T.D.);\nSivasamboo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1995] 1 F.C. 741; 87 F.T.R. 46; 29 Admin. L.R.(2d) 211 (T.D.).", "005": "[5]\nIn May of 1996 he moved to the house of a friend in the town of Toluca, outside the district of the federal judicial police, where he stayed until August of that year. During this time, the applicant testified, on approximately five occasions he saw outside the house cars with tinted glass windows of the kind often used by the police. Fearing that he was still being sought by the police, he returned to Mexico City, where he was stopped by federal judicial police, who took his money and told him that they would kill him if they saw him again. He filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission against the federal judicial police about this incident, and shortly thereafter left for Canada.", "026": "[26]\nWe do not know, of course, how Dr. Pilowsky would define the precise location of the site of the applicant's traumatizing stressor. Nonetheless, in light of the psychological evidence before it, the Refugee Division erred in finding that it would not be unduly harsh for the applicant to relocate in Mexico outside Mexico City. The fact that the Refugee Division found that, in other respects, it would not be unreasonable to expect the applicant to return - such as the employment prospects of the applicant and his wife - does not mitigate the effect that Dr. Pilowsky predicts a return to Mexico is likely to have on his psychological condition. Indeed, some of those symptoms, such as depression, nightmares and a feeling of detachment, are likely make it much more difficult for him to undertake the search for new and different employment with the necessary energy and motivation.", "021": "[21]\nThe Board inferred from the fact that the applicant's complaint to the national human rights body about the incident of police brutality in August 1996 was referred to the body for the federal district that the matter was of purely local concern. There was no evidence before the Board to this effect, and an equally plausible explanation may simply be that, since the complaint was against a member of the federal judicial police, it fell within the jurisdiction of the human rights body for the federal district. In other words, the reference by the national body did not necessarily signify the scale of the concern that the complaint raised.", "017": "[17]\nHowever, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact \"without regard to the evidence\":\nBains v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n(1993), 63 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.\nIssue 1: A Serious Possibility Of Persecution", "015": "[15]\nThe court may infer that the administrative agency under review made the erroneous finding of fact \"without regard to the evidence\" from the agency's failure to mention in its reasons some evidence before it that was relevant to the finding, and pointed to a different conclusion from that reached by the agency. Just as a court will only defer to an agency's interpretation of its constituent statute if it provides reasons for its conclusion, so a court will be reluctant to defer to an agency's factual determinations in the absence of express findings, and an analysis of the evidence that shows how the agency reached its result.", "010": "[10]\nThe Refugee Division then turned to the contention that, even if there was no serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted outside Mexico City, it was not unreasonable in all the circumstances for the applicants to establish residence elsewhere in Mexico, and that he therefore had an internal flight alternative. In particular, it was said:\n\"The panel is of the opinion that it would not be unduly harsh for the claimants to move. They are both young, the claimant's wife is a qualified teacher. The panel believes that the claimant's training as a driver gives him a skill that can easily be transferred to a new location. The panel does not believe that it is a denial of a core human right to expect the claimant to give up driving a taxi to avoid any possible links between the various taxi drivers unions. The claimant gave no indication that he intended to resume his union activities if he returned to Mexico.\"\nD. The Issues", "008": "[8]\nIt is important to emphasize that in its reasons for decision the Refugee Division stated that the claimants were credible, and held that they had a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico City. However, as I have already indicated, the Refugee Division rejected their claims to be recognized in Canada as refugees because they had an alternative flight alternative, and thus fell outside the definition of a Convention Refugee. Applying the two-pronged test established in\nRasaratnam v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n, [1992] 1 F.C. 706; 140 N.R. 138 (F.C.A.), for determining whether an alternative flight alternative exists, the Refugee Division found that on the balance of probabilities there was no serious possibility that the applicants would be persecuted outside Mexico City, and that it was not otherwise unreasonable for them to live elsewhere in Mexico.", "013": "[13]\nAccordingly, this application for judicial review raises the following two issues:\n1. Did the Refugee Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact when it found that there was no serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted anywhere in Mexico, and was the finding of fact made without regard for the material before it, in so far as the reasons for decision make no mention of evidence that the applicant had seen police cars outside the house in Toluca where he was staying?\n2. Did the Refugee Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact when it found that it would not be unreasonable to expect the applicant to relocate in Mexico, outside Mexico City, and was this finding of fact made without regard to the material before it, in so far as the Refugee Division failed to mention in its reasons evidence of the adverse psychological impact on the applicant of being returned to Mexico?\nE. Analysis", "006": "[6]\nThe applicant provided documentary evidence about the scale and nature of official corruption, and the attendant violence, that represent serious social and human rights problems in Mexico. He claimed that municipal government is effectively run by officials of the national government, and that the influence of the governing party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (the PRI) was pervasive throughout governmental bodies in Mexico. Thus, while the taxi industry in Mexico City is formally run by municipal officials, they are subject to direction from officials at the national level. As a stark indication of the violence that is endemic in the taxi industry, the applicant stated in his personal information form that in May 1996 35 taxi drivers were murdered in Mexico City, 20 of whom worked from the same base as the applicant.", "020": "[20]\nThe Board also relied on the fact that state police forces are separate and distinct and that there was no reason to think that a person such as the applicant, who was not on an official \"wanted\" list, would face the same kind of problems from members of police forces outside the federal district. However, the applicant's evidence that he had seen outside the house in Toluca cars with tinted windows similar to those often used by police forces was not contradicted. This indicates that the Board may have been mistaken in concluding that a law abiding citizen in Mexico who has been beaten, threatened and otherwise harassed for resisting the demands of corrupt officials by members of one police force has nothing to fear from members of other forces. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the fact that the applicant had been traced by the police to Toluca, which is in the state of Mexico and no more than approximately a hundred miles from Mexico City, does not necessarily prove that he would not be safe if he were to relocate much further away from the capital. Mexico, as counsel for the respondent reminded me, is a very large country, and the applicant's name is not in the national law enforcement computer records.", "002": "[2]\nThe principal applicant relies on s. 18.1(4)(d) of the\nFederal Court Act\nwhich provides that the court may set aside a decision on the ground that the federal board, commission, or other tribunal under review\n\"based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it ;\"\nHe alleges in particular that, by failing in its reasons to refer to items of evidence before it, the Refugee Division made findings of fact pertaining to the availability of an internal flight alternative in Mexico that were erroneous, and were made \"without regard for the material before it\".", "011": "[11]\nThe applicant takes no issue with the Board's formulation of the applicable legal tests to determine whether the applicant had an internal flight alternative, and was therefore not a refugee within the meaning of the Convention. Nor does he allege that, on the evidence before it, the Board's findings of fact that the applicant faced no serious possibility of persecution outside Mexico City and that it was not unreasonable for him to relocate elsewhere in Mexico, were made in a perverse or capricious manner. Rather, he says that, by failing in their reasons to mention and address the applicant's evidence that he saw what he thought were police vehicles outside the house in Toluca where he stayed in the spring and summer of 1996, the Board's finding that on the balance of probabilities there was no possibility that the applicant would be persecuted outside Mexico City was erroneous and made \"without regard to the evidence\".", "009": "[9]\nThe Refugee Division based its finding that the applicants had no reason to fear persecution outside Mexico City on the ground that this was where the incidents giving rise to their fear had occurred, and that the applicants had adduced no evidence that police forces outside the federal district were involved in persecuting the principal applicant. Moreover, the Refugee Division noted, the fact that the National Human Rights Commission had transferred the applicant's complaint to the Commission responsible for the federal district was evidence of the essentially local nature of the principal applicant's concerns.", "012": "[12]\nThe applicant makes a similar attack in respect of the Board's finding that it would not be unduly harsh to return the applicant to Mexico: the omission from its reasons of any reference to Dr. Pilowsky's evidence that, if returned to Mexico, the applicants' symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were likely to reemerge, rendered the finding erroneous and made without regard to the evidence.", "028": "[28]\nI am supported in this conclusion by the decision of Richard, J. (as he then was), in\nSingh (Gurmeet) and Narang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1995), 97 F.T.R. 139; 30 Imm. L.R.(2d) 226 (T.D.), where the failure of the Refugee Division to mention a relevant and credible psychological report respecting the reasonableness of requiring a refugee claimant to return to his country of origin was held to be an error of law. There are other cases where the omission of any discussion of similar reports has been found not to vitiate the decision:\nJhutty v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1996] F.C.J. No. 763 (T.D.);\nCanizalez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1997] F.C.J. No. 1492; F.T.R. Uned. 663 (T.D.);\nRandhawa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, [1998] F.C.J. No. 749; F.T.R. Uned. 064 (T.D.). However, in these cases, unlike the case at bar, the Board did at least specifically mention or acknowledge the report, so as to justify an inference that the Board had had regard to it.\nF. Conclusion", "004": "[4]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Mexico who, on his arrival in Canada on September 14, 1996, claimed to be a refugee, alleging that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion and membership of a particular social group (a taxi drivers' union). The Refugee Division found that, while he was a taxi driver in Mexico City, the applicant had been the subject of beatings and threats of violence in 1995 and 1996 by the federal judicial police, the force responsible for Mexico City, and by persons unknown who entered his taxi as passengers. His taxi was at one time stolen and vandalized, and he and his wife were robbed on different occasions. The applicant's evidence was that his problems stemmed from his refusal to hand over to corrupt officials a percentage of his daily earnings, and his becoming a member of a taxi drivers' union that was formed to resist demands of this nature.", "025": "[25]\nDr. Pilowsky was not asked why it would be re-traumatizing to require the applicant to return to a part of Mexico where he had not experienced persecution. Perhaps she did not consider this possibility because it was not put specifically to her. Or perhaps she would say that, even though the applicant only experienced persecution in Mexico City, his belief that he was being sought by the police when he was in Toluca is likely to cause him to associate the traumatizing stressor with any of the judicial forces, whether state or federal. Moreover, his evidence that he fears the national authorities, and believes that the influence of corrupt officials extends through the PRI to the local government level, also suggests that the psychological source of his stress may not be confined to Mexico City.", "001": "[1]\nEvans, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review brought under s. 18.1 of the\nFederal Court Act\nin which the principal applicant asks the court to set aside a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (hereinafter the Refugee Division) dated January 19, 1998 dismissing his claim for refugee status on the ground that he had an internal flight alternative anywhere in Mexico outside Mexico City. The other applicants are his wife and son, whose claims for refugee status were rejected with the principal applicant's.", "016": "[16]\nOn the other hand, the reasons given by administrative agencies are not to be read hypercritically by a court (\nMedina v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n(1990), 120 N.R. 385; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 33 (F.C.A.)), nor are agencies required to refer to every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it (see, for example,\nHassan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n(1992), 147 N.R. 317 (F.C.A.). That would be far too onerous a burden to impose upon administrative decision-makers who may be struggling with a heavy case-load and inadequate resources. A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact.", "003": "[3]\nThe other applicants' claims, which are also based on their family relationship to the principal applicant, succeed or fail with the claim of the principal applicant.

The Facts", "007": "[7]\nA psychologist, Dr. Pilowsky, whom the applicant and his wife consulted in Toronto, testified that in her opinion the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition frequently found in victims of persecution. She went on to say that, while the applicant's condition had improved while he had been in Canada, the symptoms, including depression, acute anxiety, insomnia and a lack of interest in life, were likely to recur if he was required to return to Mexico, \"the site of the traumatizing stressor\", to use the words found in the report that Dr. Pilowsky prepared for the applicants' counsel. Dr. Pilowsky also reported that Ms. Cepeda was suffering from moderate anxiety and post-traumatic nightmares. For both of them, Dr Pilowsky concluded, a return to Mexico would be a \"highly retraumatizing experience\".\nC.

In addition, their claim did contain numerous personal allegations against members of the Caldwell First Nation Band council. However, the focus of their claim was on the electoral process, the accountability of the Band Council, and the propriety and the manner in which the Settlement had been negotiated.", "022": "[22]\nThe litigation between the Claimants and the Band Council brought a number of festering issues to a head, and resulted in negotiated settlement that will no doubt contribute to a better environment and understanding in the community, to the credit of all parties.", "023": "[23]\nBearing in mind the entirety of the record before the Court, I am not satisfied that it would be appropriate to award costs against the Claimants who, in the end, were simply attempting to have their voices heard.

The government had agreed to pay $23,400,000 in settlement of the Caldwells' claims relating to their eviction from their lands without a proper surrender. The Settlement was characterized by the Band Council as the single most important event in the history of the Caldwells. The Claimants, however, had serious concerns regarding the propriety of the actions of the Band Council with respect to the negotiation of the Settlement, and the manner in which the ratification vote was being conducted. They therefore brought an application for judicial review in T-850-99 and moved for an interim and interlocutory injunction restraining the Band Councillors and Chief from conducting the ratification vote.", "021": "[21]\nThe Court must also be mindful about the chilling effect of awarding costs against a party after the conclusion of a mediation.

We believe that should take place as soon as possible. We signed the agreement in principle and in good faith, on the understanding that the next election will be open, transparent and fair and will occur soon after the Band approves a new code.", "015": "[15]\nThe Band Council claims that it would have prevailed had the proceedings gone to hearing.

As indicated in the reasons in these matters dated the 9th of November, 1999, it was only at the beginning of the trial that the plaintiffs focused their claims. It was also not until the beginning of trial that the plaintiffs dropped very significant claims for relief and focused their remaining substantive claim, that being for a permanent injunction, even though that claim continued to be stated in very broad terms. In summary, the plaintiffs presented an amorphous and moving target.

This finding is in spite of my earlier comments regarding commencement of three separate actions, failure on the part of the plaintiffs to specifically define their claims and the reliefs sought prior to the commencement of trial, extension by the defendant of its counterclaim to cover self-copying services, and failure by the defendant to effectively define its constitutional defences at an earlier stage of the proceedings.

The Board in reaching its decision that the applicant was not likely to be persecuted in Colombo focused almost exclusively on the applicant's situation. It made the statement that she did not fit into the profile of a young Tamil female LTTE member but did not explain what that profile was. The Board focused its attention on the position of the applicant, particularly her age, and did not assess the likelihood of the children being the subject of persecution.

In Colombo, she paid an agent 500,000 rupees (described as a \"small fortune\") to conduct the three of them out of Sri Lanka and into Canada. Her husband had deserted her in 1980 and thus the nuclear family unit comprised only the three individuals. The agent, just before the date of leaving, told her that he did not have the papers for her son's journey immediately available, but the son would follow and they would meet in Singapore. This did not happen. This same agent told the applicant that although she had a valid passport which covered both herself and her two children that she should leave it behind in Sri Lanka.

You must know, the Tamil Tigers, the other extremists, they torture, mutilate and murder people. There are thousands or tens of thousands of these murderers in your country. You are not one of these people. I can't even imagine a person remotely considering or perceiving you to be one of these people. Your claim is based on your fear that the Sri Lankan authorities might find out that your plantation has been confiscated. It simply appears, quite frankly, outrageous, your fear that you would be arrested at the airport in Colombo, tortured and killed.

That letter cautions governments against sending individuals back to Sri Lanka on the ground that there is a valid IFA to some parts of the country, including Colombo. The letter indicates that a reasonable IFA may exist when an individual has had a history of residence in the relevant area, or has close relatives in the area or has a history of past employment in the area. The Board indicated that the factors, identified by the UNHCR, were preferences and not requirements. The Board went on to state that Colombo was a reasonable alternative for the applicant, despite the fact that none of the three circumstances, identified by the UNHCR, existed in her case. The Board found Colombo to be a reasonable alternative because of the applicant's age, social status and the financial support from relatives who lived elsewhere.", "009": "[9]\nIt may be that, taken literally, the presiding member's words can be said to demonstrate prejudgment.

Also, he was trying to reassure the applicant that, in his view, she could return to Sri Lanka without difficulty. The statements, although made before the close of the evidence were made, close to the end of the proceedings, when the presiding member could be expected to have come to a provisional conclusion with regard to the evidence. That his mind was not closed would seem to be evident from his statement to the applicant that her lawyer would be making submissions on all issues.

Is the Board suggesting that she is young enough to establish herself in employment in that city? More importantly, what is meant by the Board when it refers to her social status is not explained.

Third, the Board relied on the applicant's circumstances and particularly her age (41) when assessing the likelihood of persecution without also taking account of the situation of her two children.

While different panels of the Federal Court of Appeal have variously expressed the duty of this court on appeal to be to determine whether the registrar has \"clearly erred\", or whether he has simply \"gone wrong\", it appears that it is the duty of a judge sitting on an appeal such as this to come to his own conclusion as to the cor\u00adrectness of the finding of the registrar. In doing that he must, however, take into account\nthe special experience and knowledge\nof the registrar or the Board, and more importantly have regard to whether new evidence has been put before him that was not before the Board.'\" [see footnote 31] (Emphasis added)\nIt is interesting to note the reference to the standard of correctness, while at the same time acknowledging the special experience and knowledge of the trademark hearing officer.", "014": "[14]\nSection 14(6) of the\nAct\nis intended to preclude any appeal from the decision of the Federal Court - Trial Division.

In my opinion, it is open to the citizenship judge to adopt either one of the conflicting schools in this court and, if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of the chosen approach, the decision of the citizen\u00adship judge would not be wrong. Until now, Federal Court trial judges, presiding over the de novo hearings, have generally felt free to substitute their view of the residency re\u00adquirement for the one expressed in the de\u00adcision under appeal.

The specialization, and perhaps the expertise, of a citizenship judge may be more analogous with that of a non-lawyer member of the Refugee Division or decision maker in a trademark application.

[see footnote 16] This change appears to remove the discretion to credit the applicant for citizenship, with days towards the residency requirement, when the person is in fact absent from Canada. Bill C-63 will also remove the statutory appeal, now found in s. 14(5).

Some judges of this court have adopted the view that the residency requirement in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the\nAct\nentails more than a mere counting of days. This view was first enunciated in\nPapadogiorgakis, Re\n[see footnote 7] by Thurlow, A.C.J., as he then was, when he stated:\n\"It seems to me that the words 'residence' and 'resident' in paragraph 5(1)(b) of the new\nCitizenship Act\nare not as strictly limited to actual presence in Canada throughout the period as they were in the former statute but can include, as well, situations in which the person concerned has a place in Canada which is used by him during the period as a place of abode to a sufficient extent to demonstrate the reality of his residing there during the material period even though he is away from it part of the time.\n. . . . .\n\"A person with an established home of his own in which he lives does not cease to be resident there when he leaves it for a temporary purpose whether on business or vacation or even to pursue a course of study. The fact of his family remaining there while he is away may lend support for the conclusion that he has not ceased to reside there. The conclusion may be reached, as well, even though the absence may be more or less lengthy. It is also enhanced if he returns there frequently when the opportunity to do so arises. It is, as Rand, J., appears to me to be saying in the passage I have read, 'chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question'.\" [see footnote 8]\nThe principle in\nPapadogiorgakis\nwas succinctly stated by Dub\u00e9, J., in\nBanerjee,\nRe\n[see footnote 9]: \"It is the quality of the attachment to Canada that is to be ascer\u00adtained.\" Justice Dub\u00e9 has more recently reiterated his view in\nHo, Re\n: [see footnote 10]\n\"As I have stated on many occasions, residency in Canada for the purposes of citizenship does not imply full-time physical presence. The place of residence of a person is not where that person works but where he or she returns to after work. Hence, an applicant for citizenship who has clearly and definitively established a home in Canada with the transparent inten\u00adtion of maintaining permanent roots in this country ought not to be deprived of citizenship merely because he has to earn his livelihood and that of his family by doing business offshore.\nThe most eloquent indicia of residency is the permanent establishment of a person and his family in the country.\n\" (see footnote 11] (Emphasis added.)", "034": "[34]\nIn this case, the Citizenship judge does not appear to have focussed on the cir\u00adcumstances of the applicant's presence in Canada, prior to her joining her husband in China in February 1996. During this time, she remained within Canada except for one short vacation, she married and continued to live in Canada with her husband and was gainfully employed here. These are strong indicia of her having centralized her mode of living in Canada. Since joining her husband on his assignment for Greenpeace Canada, she has returned to Vancouver in June 1996 to settle legal matters concerning their new residence, and, with her husband, to celebrate the holiday season with his family in December 1997 and to attend her father-in-law's swearing in ceremony as a Canadian citizen in July 1997.", "009": "[9]\nUnder the former\nFederal Court Rules\n, an appeal pursuant to s. 14(5) proceeded by way of trial de novo. [see footnote 4] This is no longer the case. According to rule 300(c) of the\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n, a citizen\u00adship appeal is now dealt with as an ap\u00adplication. However, the statutory appeal from the decision of a citizenship judge is not an application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the\nFederal Court Act\n. [see footnote 5]", "012": "[12]\nA number of other judges of this court have adopted a different view. In his recent decision in\nHarry, Re\n, [see footnote 12] Justice Muldoon repeated his strongly held opinion concerning the proper interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(c):\n\"20. To give away citizenship to those who do not take the trouble to comply with the provisions solemnly enacted by Parliament is not only a kind of\nl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\n, but it just cheapens Canadian citizenship. Serious, sincere applicants simply must comply with the law, in common with everyone else, whether they like it or not. What a terrible message this court sends, by overruling a citizenship judge, and granting someone citizenship by defeating Parliament's will! The court does not make\nitself\nlook good by that sort of false bounty. It does not foster respect for the law.\n\"21. It appears clearly that all of the fore\u00adgoing is not merely judicial speculation or prattle. Parliament has been amending the\nCitizenship Act\nfrom time to time since the promulgation of the revised statutes. It has not taken any occasion to enact any provision whatever regarding the residence rules, to make any exception or provide for the granting of citizenship to any applicant who\n- would likely be a good citizen, but fails to comply with paragraph 5(1)(c);\n- has 'centralized' his or her 'lifestyle' in Canada because of any circumstance, but is absent;\n- has sent or deposited his or her per\u00adsonal property (i.e. bank account, clothing, automobile, etc.) to reside in Canada, while the applicant is absent from this country;\n- has become 'Canadianized' in less time than the prescribed three of the im\u00admediately previous four years;\n- needs to be out of Canada on business or whatever for longer than one year of the immediately previous four years;\n- has a spouse and/or children or other family members who are already citizens.\n\"22. This trend of ignoring the law as Parliament wrote it seems to have started with\nPapadogiorgakis\n, [1978] 2 F.C. 208. Although that case was decided by an eminent judge of the day, the decision is not binding simply because there is no appeal from these citizenship appeal judg\u00adments. This factor can create, and does still create a scandalous incertitude in the law.\" [see footnote 13]", "028": "[28]\nIt is useful to consider briefly the few procedures set out for citizenship ap\u00adplications. According to s. 12 of the\nCitizen\u00adship Regulations, 1993\n, [see footnote 37] there is no requirement for the recording of testimony received by the citizenship judge, even where it is given under oath. The absence of a transcript was not a serious issue in a de novo appeal before this court. In a statutory appeal by way of application, however, the absence of the record can only be compensated by fulsome affidavits con\u00adcerning the information the applicant for citizenship provided to the citizenship judge.

Appellate courts must resist such temptations. My statement that I might not have come to the same con\u00adclusion as the Tribunal should not be taken as an invitation to appellate courts to inter\u00advene in cases such as this one but rather as a caution against such intervention and a call for restraint.

In\nMcTague v. Canada (A.G.)\n, supra, Justice Evans (as he was then) stated:\n\"The weight of the factors considered above in the pragmatic or functional analysis suggests that Parliament should be regarded as prescribing a deferential standard of review in this case. However, they do not indicate that the most deferential standard should be applied. 'Patent unreasonableness' seems increasingly to be reserved as the standard of review applied to the decisions of administrative agencies that are protected by strong preclusive clauses and have a wider range of regulatory responsibilities than the merely adjudicative functions performed by the Board.

Moreover, the Board asked no questions about the applicant's record of parachute jumps to which he referred in this appeal to the Board. In this application, records of those jumps are submitted under Mr. Wood's affidavit in support of his application for judicial review. It is urged that the Board failed to exercise its duty to consider or reject evidence in light of its credibility and reasonableness (see\nMacDonald v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, [1999] F.C.J.

The applicant must still establish on a balance of probabilities, with the evidence considered in the best light possible, that his disability is service-related. This civil standard must be read in concert with the entitling provision of paragraph 21(2)(a) of the\nPension Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Without impeaching evidence and without addressing the letter's substance in its reasons and conclusions, which found the applicant's complaint did not arise and was not directly connected with service in peacetime, the Board failed to \"expressly [deal] with evidence from which an inference favourable to the applicant might have been drawn\" (see\nWeare v.

Regarding the applicant's contention that Major Zaporzan's evidence was not considered by the Board, counsel submits that the Board referred to Major Zaporzan's letter in its reasons but did not give it much weight because Major Zaporzan is not a physician and therefore was not qualified to diagnose the applicant's injury.", "002": "[2]\nThe application is brought under section 18.1 of the\nFederal Court Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c.

On judicial review, a Court can consider only evidence that was before the administrative decision-maker whose decision is being reviewed and not new evidence (see\nBrychka v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, supra;\nFranz v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n(1995), 80 F.T.R. 79 (T.D.);\nVia Rail Canada Inc. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.\n, [1997] F.C.J.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1995), 100 F.T.R. 139; 29 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (T.D.). In this case, the applicant sought to introduce records concerning his 28 parachute jumps and his running, providing further evidence to support his case. These records were not before the Board, or before the Entitlement Board which first considered his pension appeal. This Court takes no cognizance of this further evidence here offered for the purposes of this application for judicial review. The applicant may wish to consult the Board about tendering these records either for its consideration, or perhaps in relation to a new application for pension benefits to be considered first by an Entitlement Board.\nConclusion", "009": "[9]\nDuring Mr. Wood's Medical Examination for Release on February 10, 1998, the examiner recorded \"low back pain\" under the heading of \"Current Diseases or Injuries.\" The examiner, in the Report, cited Toronto as the place of origin for the injury, and the Spring of 1995 as the date of its origin. Regarding the cause of the injury, the examiner recorded Mr. Wood's complaint concerning his back as \"Back pain - sports injury (CF) hockey and exercise\". Under Part 5 of the examination report, the examiner records that Mr. Wood \"has had low back pain which is [contained?] by regular exercise as per physiotherapy\".", "012": "[12]\nFollowing the applicant's request for a review of this decision, the Entitlement Review Board of the Board rejected Mr. Wood's claim for pension benefits with respect to his low back pain in a decision dated April 6, 1999. The Board, in its decision, concluded that \"the claimed condition did not arise out of nor is directly connected with or was not permanently worsened by carrying out of service responsibilities or service factors\".", "028": "[28]\nThe Board may reject the applicant's evidence when it has before it contradictory medical evidence. However, while there may be an absence of evidence in the form of definitive medical documentation about the injury claimed, where there is no contradictory evidence and the Board does not accept the applicant's evidence without explanation of that, it commits an error that goes to jurisdiction (see\nMoar v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.)). A decision of the Board that errs in the exercise of its jurisdiction, is unreasonable and warrants intervention by the Court. The standard of patent unreasonableness, in my opinion, is not apt if the error concerns the exercise of the Board's jurisdiction.", "030": "[30]\nIn its reasons, the Board wrote that \"There is no medical record available [for the applicant] since November 1996\". Immediately following that, the Board writes \"The Medical Examiner at the time of the Medical Examination for Release dated 10 February 1998 simply indicated that the Appellant 'has had low back pain.'\" Clearly, there was a medical record available since 1996 in the form of the 1998 Medical Examination for Release report. I note that this report does more than simply state that the applicant has had low back pain. Rather it states that the applicant has had low back pain, which originated in the Spring of 1995 and was related to training and a hockey injury, in activity that the applicant claims was service related. The report also provides that the applicant controls the pain through stretching and physiotherapy.", "004": "[4]\nDuring his 24 years of service, the applicant engaged in numerous strenuous activities that included risk of injury. Between 1981 and 1987, Mr. Wood participated in 28 parachute jumps as part of his regular service in the military. He reports that these jumps put stress on his lower back and that some of his landings were particularly hard.", "025": "[25]\nIn the case at the bar, the applicant has relied upon medical records and a letter from Major Zaporzan testifying about the latter's awareness of a low back injury to the applicant. Taken together, there is evidence that the applicant injured his back in 1995/96 as a result of training for an EXPRESS fitness test and subsequently falling on his lower spine after being hit in an organized hockey game that was part of a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College event. This evidence is uncontradicted.", "001": "[1]\nMacKay, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review and for an Order setting aside the decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Canada (the \"Board\"), dated September 8, 1999, and communicated to the applicant by letter dated October 14, 1999, concerning the pension entitlement of the applicant under section 21(2) of the\nPension Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, P-6.", "016": "[16]\nThe applicant submits that the Board did not expressly find the evidence presented lacked credibility, and yet it failed on the evidence to resolve the case in favour of the applicant, which, it is urged, under section 39 of the\nVeterans Review and Appeal Board Act\n, S.C. 1995, c. 18, is to be done whenever there is doubt about the validity of the veteran's claim. All of the evidence, medical and otherwise, counsel submits, establishes a link between the applicant's low back pain and his service related activities. The applicant's evidence regarding his training for the EXPRESS fitness test, his 28 parachute jumps and his hockey injury during a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College event were, submits counsel, sufficiently strenuous and service-related to warrant the granting of a disability pension.", "003": "[3]\nThe applicant served in the regular armed forces from August 1, 1975 to August 24, 1998.

His counsel argues that the applicant, in August - September of 1989, lost contact with his lawyer and therefore never knew about the August 30, 1989 decision of Mr. Justice MacKay. This is not a compelling argument. Individuals in the position of the applicant, have some obligation to keep in touch with their counsel or their counsel's firm, if the particular counsel in question leaves that firm. An individual has a responsibility to take initiatives and actively pursue the claims being made. It is not sufficient to place oneself in a position where communication is difficult or nonexistent and then plead lack of knowledge of what occurred, as a grounds for seeking an extension of the time limits.", "010": "[10]\nAs I understood counsel's argument, it is that Mr. Justice MacKay's decision should be reconsidered insofar as it refused a stay of the applicant's deportation order. The argument before me was not based on any inconsistency between Mr. Justice MacKay's reasons and the order he gave. The argument was merely that the Court had jurisdiction to order such a stay; see\nToth v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\n, [1989] 1 F.C. 535; 86 N.R. 302 (F.C.A.) and\nYhap v.

Any decision on the merits of a rule 337(5) application can only be made by the judge who rendered the decision which it is sought to have reconsidered. I have already indicated that the claimant has not proven good cause for the delay so as to justify an extension of time for filing a s. 18 application. Those reasons equally apply to the request for an extension of the 10 day time limit set out in rule 337(5).", "009": "[9]\nThe applicant seeks reconsideration of the decision of Mr. Justice MacKay, rendered August 30, 1989, pursuant to rule 337(5):\n\"Within 10 days of the pronouncement of judgment under paragraph (2)(a), or such further time as the Court may allow, either before or after the expiration of that time, either party may move the Court, as constituted at the time of the pronouncement, to reconsider the terms of the pronouncement, on one or both of the following grounds, and no others:\n(a) that the pronouncement does not accord with reasons, if any, that may have been given therefor;\n(b) that some matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or omitted.\"", "012": "[12]\nI have considered whether the judge who initially rendered the decision, of which reconsideration is sought, must also be the judge who decides on an extension of time. Rule 337(5) does not expressly so provide.

In most instances, it is probably both practical and usual for the same judge to make both decisions. In this case, however, since the 337(5) motion is interconnected to the rule 5(2) motion, the most efficient procedure was for me to deal with both requests.\nConclusion", "004": "[4]\nOn becoming aware of what had happened, the applicant's counsel asked immigration authorities to now review the applicant's case to see whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds for granting landed immigrant status existed. Officials agreed; this was in September, 1990. Although it is not part of the affidavit material on the record, counsel for the respondent advised me that immigration officials had been willing, since September, to do such a review but that representations on the applicant's behalf had not been presented to them. Counsel for the respondent indicated that the Minister is still willing to undertake such a review if representations with respect thereto are forthcoming from the applicant. In any event, in the absence of appropriate initiatives from the applicant, pursuing his request for a review, officials notified the applicant on January 31, 1991, that arrangements were being made for his deportation.", "001": "[1]\nReed, J.\n: The application brings a motion for an extension of time pursuant to rule 5(2) of the\nFederal Court Immigration Rules\n. The extension is sought to enable the applicant to commence a proceeding under s. 18 of the\nFederal Court Act\nto challenge a decision of the Minister. The decision in question was rendered in early August, 1989. The Minister refused to grant the applicant landed immigrant status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. (s. 114(2) of the\nImmigration Act\n). On August 30, 1989, Mr. Justice MacKay granted the applicant leave to commence a s. 18 application to challenge this decision but refused to issue a stay of the deportation order which at that time was outstanding against the applicant.", "003": "[3]\nIn fact, the applicant moved from Toronto to Ottawa sometime around this time. His affidavit discloses that he was working in Ottawa in the August-September 1989 period. On July 15, 1990, the applicant was stopped by the police (perhaps for a traffic violation) and it was discovered that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest because of the deportation order which had been issued against him. He was detained in custody and subsequently hired his present counsel.", "007": "[7]\nLastly, the respondent's open-ended offer to cause a review of the applicant's situation for the purpose of assessing whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist, is a relevant factor. An order for an extension of time is a discretionary remedy.

Further, that the RPD had failed to thoroughly assess the reasonableness of the IFA locations in the context of the applicant's situation and vulnerable mindset. As a young man with little education and no prospects of employment he was in a high risk category and his lack of family and fragile psychological state compounded that risk. Therefore, the decision of the RPD was unreasonable. Similarly, in\nOkafor\n, Justice Beaudry found that the applicant suffered from physical and emotional stress, and was a single mother with no formal education and no family support. The RPD's analysis concluding that there was a possible IFA was unreasonable because it did not take into account the applicant's personal particular situation. In the assessment of the second prong of the test, an IFA must be reasonable for the particular claimant in the context of the particular country.", "046": "[46]\nGiven that the onus is on the Applicants to demonstrate that a proposed IFA location is not suitable, in my view it was within the possible, acceptable outcomes for the RAD to find that the Applicants had failed to do so.

In my view, the RAD's determination on these points was also reasonable.", "041": "[41]\nIn my view, even if this were accepted as evidence of a connection of Subhas to Sikh \"fanatics\", the Applicants do not explain how Subhas' alleged association with Sikh fundamentalists gives rise to a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA locations and the record contains no evidence in that regard. The RAD also pointed out that the Applicants had been able to live in a community just 60 km outside of Delhi for ten years and were only located by Subhas when the female Applicant's family provided him with information. And, given the description of Subhas found in the lawyer's affidavit, it found that he likely did not have the ability to locate the Applicants among millions of people in major centers, long distances from his home. In my view, the RAD's conclusion was not unreasonable.", "031": "[31]\nIt is of note that Dr. Choi referred to her discussions with the female Applicant as well as with her daughter, Cheheleena, who believed that her mother's distress was exacerbated by the adjustment of residing in a new country and having limited financial security. Further, that the stress of having the family's refugee claim rejected and the possibility of having to return to India contributed to her mother's overall distress. Dr. Choi concluded that the female Applicant continues to experience profound fear and depressed mood which were precipitated by the traumatic events she experienced in India with her ex-husband. Her anxiety and depression were further exacerbated by having to adjust to life in Canada and even more so by recently having her refugee claim rejected and the resultant possibility of having to return to India. Dr. Choi stated that the female Applicant's presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder, single episode, chronic, severe, and suggested a trial of two medications. Significantly, however, there was no suggestion as to the impact, if any, that return to India would have on the female Applicant's mental health. Nor was there any evidence in the record that the female Applicant was taking the suggested medications, although the report states that Dr. Choi would see her for follow up in two weeks' time, or that she would be unable to access those medications in India.", "018": "[18]\nIn my view, this was reasonable. The IFA analysis conducted by both the RPD and RAD presumed that Subhas did exist and that he was Ankush and Cheheleena's father. Further, the Applicants' reliance on\nKhachatourian\nis misplaced as, in that case, the Court found that where a central credibility finding is flawed, the RAD must consider its impact on the rest of the credibility findings. There, credibility was the only finding and there was no distinct alternative analysis, as is the case in this matter. And, upon review of the RAD's reasons, I find that the RAD's IFA analysis was not impacted by the RPD's credibly findings concerning paternity.", "040": "[40]\nThe Applicants point to the affidavit of the male Applicant which states that, following the incident outside his daughter's school, an attending police officer told him that one of the men accompanying Subhas had an identity card showing that he was a member of the committee that governs Sikh gurudwaras for all of India. The male Applicant stated that the committee is notorious for being fanatical about the Sikh religion. Further, that Subhas had called him to say that he had complained to the committee about the family and that it believed that Cheheleena had to be brought into the Sikh religion and married to a Sikh man. And, that after the family fled to Canada, their home was broken into and vandalized with graffiti on the walls \"that was obviously the work of Sikh fanatics\", although no explanation as to why this was obvious was provided.", "045": "[45]\nThe RAD concluded that the Applicants' subjective reluctance to seek police protection did not rebut the presumption that it exists and that they had not provided clear and convincing evidence that, if they were to make a complaint against Subhas, state protection would not be available to them. In my view, the RAD's finding was reasonable and to come to a different conclusion would be to re-weigh the evidence that was before the RAD which is not the role of this Court (\nMcLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)\n, 2013 SCC 67 at paras 19-33;\nDunsmuir\nat para 47).", "042": "[42]\nWith respect to the\nGender Guidelines\n, while the RAD's assessment could have been more thorough, it stated that it had considered all relevant factors, including the social and cultural context in which the Applicants' allegations arose, and that country conditions were examined in consideration of the\nGender Guidelines\n.", "024": "[24]\nThe Respondent submits that it was open to the RAD to confirm the RPD's assessment of the Riback Report. The RPD had several credibility concerns, only one of which was related to paternity.

For the same reasons, it was also open to the RAD to assign little weight to the Choi Report which was based on self-reporting rather than independent assessments. Regardless, the RAD concluded that the Applicants had failed to show that they could not obtain the recommended psychological treatment in the proposed IFA locations.", "019": "[19]\nAccordingly, I find that in these circumstances the RAD did not err in declining to make a determination on the admissibility of the DNA and Birth Certificate Reports.\nIssue 2: Was the RAD's determination that an IFA was available to the Applicants reasonable?\nApplicants' Position", "022": "[22]\nThe Applicants also submit that because the female Applicant faces risk from her ex-husband and her daughter is at risk of a forced marriage, gender is central to their claim. However, that the RAD failed to engage in a meaningful way with the\nGender Guidelines\n. The RAD also failed to consider objective evidence which demonstrated the prevalence of gender-based violence in India and lack of state protection, which was consistent with the Applicants' subjective experience.", "029": "[29]\nThe Riback Report does not provide the basis for the author's belief that the Applicants would all likely face physical danger and trauma if they returned to India. Nor does it assess the impact of returning to cities far from her hometown, including the proposed IFAs. Further, as the RAD noted, and unlike\nLainez\n, the Riback Report does not include details of any testing upon which its conclusions concerning the female Applicant were based. It states only that the author's clinical impression was based on her experience, training and ability to evaluate and assess symptoms of trauma, anxiety and depression. There is also no evidence in the record that the female Applicant followed up with its author on the suggested future counselling sessions.", "023": "[23]\nAdditionally, the RAD failed to mention crucial evidence in the form of an affidavit sworn by an Indian lawyer which stated that Subhas' father was a member of a Sikh extremist group, Babbar Khals. The RAD concluded that there was no persuasive evidence that Subhas was associated with Sikh fundamentalists, yet that affidavit established a serious possibility that the Applicants would be persecuted in the proposed IFA as Subhas has connections to criminal groups with extensive influence in India.\nRespondent's Position", "014": "[14]\nThe parties submit and I agree that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review. Because the RAD's assessment of an IFA is primarily a factual inquiry it attracts deference (\nDunsmuir v New Brunswick\n, 2008 SCC 9 at para 53 [\nDunsmuir\n]), it is also well-established that determinations on the availability of an IFA are reviewed on the reasonableness standard (\nMomodu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2015 FC 1365 at para 6 [\nMomodu\n]).\nIssue 1: Did the RAD err by failing to address the new evidence as to paternity?", "044": "[44]\nIn any event, in its state protection analysis the RAD acknowledged that the objective evidence in the record on state protection was mixed. That evidence included information concerning gender based violence. It is well established that decision-makers are presumed to have considered all of the evidence on the record (\nNewfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board)\n, 2011 SCC 62 at para 16) although that presumption may be rebutted by a failure to expressly consider evidence that directly contradicts the decision. In my view, however, that is not the situation in this matter. Here the RAD was aware of the mixed nature of the evidence and weighed the Applicants' testimony of their personal encounters with police against the mixed objective evidence. It noted, for example, that while the female Applicant claimed that the police did not seem interested in assisting her, her testimony indicated that they attended at the school when called and that they acted appropriately. They spoke to her and her husband, gathered information and informed her that if there were additional problems she should attend at the police station and file a First Information Report. She did not do so. And, after the second incident at her home, the police again attended. While the male Applicant's affidavit asserts that the family was not happy with the response, he also stated that he had not complained to a higher authority as he thought the police were too busy.", "005": "[5]\nThe Applicants' claim for refugee protection was denied by the RPD on December 2, 2014. The determinative factor was the credibility of their claim. The RPD found that the Applicants had provided an insufficient explanation as to why the male Applicant's name appeared on the children's birth certificates and found that it was more probable than not that he was their biological father. Further, that the Applicants had not established that Subhas was Ankush and Cheheleena's father or that he existed and was targeting the Applicants. The RPD assigned little weight to a report from a psychotherapist, Natalie Riback, dated November 18, 2014 (\"Riback Report\") because its author had relied on the information provided by the female Applicant in preparing the report. The RPD did not believe the events as alleged by the Applicants nor that they were targeted as they claimed. In the alternative, the RPD found that even if Subhas were persecuting the Applicants, they had access to an internal flight alternative (\"IFA\"). The Applicants' claim was again denied on June 3, 2015 on appeal to the RAD.\nDecision Under Review", "026": "[26]\nThe two pronged test for assessing an IFA is well established in the jurisprudence and was identified by the RAD in its decision. As stated in\nRasaratnam\n:\n...the Board was required to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no serious possibility of the appellant being persecuted in [the IFA] and that, in all the circumstances including circumstances particular to him, conditions in [the IFA] were such that it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to seek refuge there\n(see also\nMomodu\nat para 6;\nAbdalghader v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2015 FC 581 at para 3 [\nAbdalghader\n]).", "021": "[21]\nThe Applicants submit that the RAD's errors in assessing the reports are linked to the IFA analysis as the reports demonstrated the female Applicant's fragile mental state and, therefore, that relocation to another city in India would not be reasonable (\nOkafor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2011 FC 1002 [\nOkafor\n]).", "032": "[32]\nAs the RAD noted, the assessment by Dr. Choi was terminated early and was based on self-reporting without additional independent clinical studies. The RAD also stated that the issues that caused the female Applicant to seek further medical intervention were not necessarily the direct result of the problems she encountered in India. For these reasons, the RAD did not give the Choi Report significant weight.", "038": "[38]\nThe Applicants rely on the affidavit of the Indian lawyer to link Subhas to Sikh fundamentalists and submit that the RAD failed to mention this critical evidence. However, the RAD, in reviewing the record, specifically noted the affidavit which it stated attested to the background of Subhas. The RAD described only an excerpt of its content in its reasons but what the affiant actually says is significant; which is that Sh. Singh Gogna was the father of Sh. Subhash Gogna, and that the father \".. was associated with Sikh extermist [sic] group named Babbar Khals and he was killed by the police in the domestic vilance [sic] in the year 1984 ... That he was santed [sic] and was also had bad contact with interrogative people. He was drunker [sic], unemployed, aggressive and worthless ... That he had relation with other women as well\". In my view, at best, all that can be taken from this affidavit is that Subhas' father was associated with Babbar Khals, although the affiant does not provide the basis of his belief nor does he explain the nature of that group and how this is known to him. Nor do the Applicants explain how this purported association to the Babbar Khals by Subhas' father relates to Subhas.", "017": "[17]\nIn this situation the RPD stated that its credibility finding was determinative but also explicitly stated that, in the alternative, it considered whether an IFA was available to the Applicants. The RAD found that the IFA was the determinative issue in the appeal before it and stated that the new evidence, the DNA Report and Birth Certificate Report, did not impact its findings on that issue and, for that reason, it was not necessary to make a determination on the admissibility of that evidence.", "015": "[15]\nThe Applicants submit that the RAD erred by failing to analyse new evidence that refutes the RPD's credibility findings. This evidence was the DNA Report that confirmed that the male Applicant is not Ankush and Cheheleena's biological father, and the Birth Certificate Report that addressed how a father's name is changed on a birth certificate in India thus explaining why the male Applicant's name appears on the birth certificates of Ankush and Cheheleena as their father. The Applicants submit that this was an error because the RPD's IFA analysis was infected by its negative credibility findings (\nKhachatourian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2015 FC 182 at paras 35-36 [\nKhachatourian\n]).", "010": "[10]\nThe RAD also reviewed and considered the Riback Report which stated that the female Applicant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), generalized anxiety and a major depressive disorder. The RAD noted that it was based on a single 60-90 minute interview and self-reporting and did not refer to any clinical testing. The RAD found that, without an explanation of the clinical basis on which the psychotherapist's opinions were formed, they amounted to speculation based on what was related by the female Applicant to the psychotherapist. The RAD also placed little weight on the Choi Report for several reasons: the assessment was terminated early at the request of the female Applicant and was, therefore, a clinical impression made without a full review of her situation; the diagnosis was the same as found in the Riback Report, both of which were based on self-reporting; and, the issues that caused the female Applicant to seek further medical intervention were not necessarily the direct result of the problems encountered in India. Further, the Applicants had not provided persuasive evidence that the female Applicant would be unable to obtain the recommended treatment in the proposed IFA locations. The RAD found that there was no compelling psychological or psychiatric evidence that the two female Applicants would be unable to return to India in an IFA location.", "008": "[8]\nThe RAD also found that there was no persuasive evidence that Subhas was associated with Sikh fundamentalists. And, while Subhas was able to locate the family after they moved in 2003, at that time their home was located only 60 kilometers from their original location, Subhas had not contacted them for ten years and did not do so until their new location was given to him by the Applicants' family members.", "035": "[35]\nIn my view, the jurisprudence suggests that the RAD was entitled to weigh the psychological evidence based on the source of the facts relied on, but that the Reports could not be dismissed solely because they relied on evidence from the female Applicant. However, that is not what the RAD did in this case. Here the RAD considered the totality of the evidence, including the Riback and Choi Reports, in determining that a suitable IFA was available to the Applicants. It did not afford the Riback and Choi Reports little weight solely because of the self-reporting, it also found that the analyses were not accompanied by or based on clinical testing. And while the Applicants take issue with the RAD's statement that the issues that caused the female Applicant to seek further medical intervention were not necessarily the direct result of the problems she encountered in India, the Choi Report specifically mentions a number of factors that were attributed to the female Applicant's overall distress. The RAD further found that the Applicants had failed to establish that treatment would be unavailable to the female Applicant in the proposed IFA locations. In my view, given the foregoing, the RAD's weighing of the psychological evidence was not unreasonable in this case, particularly considering the lack of any evidence that the female Applicant followed up on the treatment and medication proposed by the authors of those reports.", "047": "[47]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. There shall be no order as to costs.\n3. No question of general importance for certification was proposed or arises.", "013": "[13]\nIn my view, the issues may be addressed as follows:\n1. Did the RAD err by failing to address the new evidence as to paternity?\n2. Did the RAD err in its IFA analysis?\nStandard of Review", "039": "[39]\nThe RAD also specifically addressed the Applicants' submission that Subhas had connections to Sikh fundamentalists. It stated that it had reviewed the record as well as the audio recording of the hearing. It also noted the Applicants' Basis of Claim form, which stated that they do not believe that Subhas has become a religious Sikh. Further, that the documents submitted by the Applicants described individuals who associate with Subhas as having the appearance of members who dress in the traditional garb of the Sikh faith, but that there was no persuasive evidence that Subhas was associated with Sikh fundamentalists.", "006": "[6]\nBefore the RAD the Applicants brought an application, pursuant to s 29(1) of the\nRefugee Appeal Division Rules\n, SOR/2012-257 (\"Rules\"), seeking to introduce a psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr. Monica Choi, dated March 6, 2015 (\"Choi Report\"), as evidence of the female Applicant's deteriorating mental state and distress exacerbated by the negative decision in her refugee claim. Because it was relevant to the assessment of the IFA and met the requirements of s 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD admitted the report as new evidence. The Applicants also sought to introduce a DNA report (\"DNA Report\"), and a report from SIFS Forensic Science Organization India (\"Birth Certificate Report\") concerning the changing of the name of a child's father on his or her Indian birth certificate, both intended to refute credibility findings made by the RPD. The RAD determined that, because the availability of an IFA was determinative of the appeal, it was unnecessary to determine if that new evidence was admissible as it was not relevant to the IFA.", "043": "[43]\nWhile the Applicants take issue with the RAD's comment that the female Applicant is married and would be accompanied to an IFA location by her husband, this was made in the context of RAD's quote of the\nGender Guidelines.\nSpecifically, that the\nGender Guidelines\nstate that decision-makers are required to consider the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and stay there without facing undue hardship. Further, the RAD's finding that the female Applicant will benefit from her husband's support is not unreasonable. Familial support, or lack thereof, has been considered as a factor in IFA analyses (\nGonzalez\nat para 12;\nOkafor\nat para 14). And, although the Applicants submit that gender based violence is central to their claim, I would note that based on the Applicants' evidence, the police reluctance to respond was not based on gender, but on religion. The male Applicant's affidavit states that the police told him following the school yard incident that they did not want to get involved in a religious confrontation and, as Subhas claimed to be Cheheleena's father, the police saw the matter as a private one concerning religion. Similarly, after the break in at the family's home, their neighbour stated that he did not want to go to the police as he was Muslim and did not want to get involved in religiously coloured matters.", "020": "[20]\nThe Applicants submit that the RAD erred by rejecting the Riback and Choi Reports as the hearsay nature of self-reporting is an insufficient ground on which to reject medical evidence (\nLainez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2012 FC 914 at para 42 [\nLainez\n]). Further, while the RAD noted that the Choi assessment was incomplete, it did not note the reason for this being that the female Applicant was in distress and indicated that she was not able to continue. The RAD's finding that the female Applicant's mental state may not have been caused as a direct result of her experiences in India is unreasonable, given the findings of the Choi Report. Finally, the Applicants submit that the fact that the Choi Report makes the same diagnosis as the Riback Report is not a reason to undermine the former, but rather speaks to the strength of the evidence, as corroborated by two separate mental health professionals.", "002": "[2]\nThe Applicants are a family of four who are citizens of India. The male Applicant, Sanjay Verma, is Hindu, and the female Applicant, Mamta Verma, is Sikh. They married in 2003. Ankush Verma is 22 years old and Cheheleena Verma is 19 years old, they are Mamta Verma's son and daughter, their biological father is her ex-husband, Subhas.", "011": "[11]\nOn the issue of state protection, the RAD found that despite the Applicants' claim that the police were unwilling to assist, the evidence indicated that the police had acted appropriately. During the first incident they spoke to the male and female Applicants as well as Subhas, gathered information and informed the female Applicant that if there were additional problems she should attend at the police station to open a First Information Report. After the second incident the police came to the family home. Although the Applicants were not happy with the police response, they did not contact a higher authority in the police department to complain. The RAD found that the Applicants' subjective reluctance to seek state protection did not rebut the presumption that state protection is available. Further, it found their allegations that the police were indifferent and unable to protect them from Subhas lacked credibility. The RAD noted that objective evidence on state protection in India is mixed and that the onus was on the Applicants to demonstrate that proposed IFA locations are unsuitable, which they had failed to do.\nIssues", "034": "[34]\nThis Court has also held that it is unreasonable to afford little weight to a psychological report solely on the basis that the events it describes were not based on first hand knowledge of the psychologist and that the RPD errs when it rejects expert psychological evidence without basis (\nLainez\nat para 42). Other jurisprudence has determined that evidence of third parties who have no means of independently verifying the facts to which they testify is likely to be ascribed little weight, whether it is credible or not (\nFerguson v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2008 FC 1067 at para 26). That principle has been applied to decision-makers' assessments of reports from counsellors (\nForde v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2012 FC 147 at paras 30-31) and letters from psychiatrists and other mental health professionals (\nNguyen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\n2015 FC 59 at paras 8-9).", "009": "[9]\nIn considering the\nChairperson's Gender Guidelines\n[\nGender Guidelines\n], the RAD noted, amongst other things, that the female Applicant is married and would be accompanied to the IFA by the male Applicant who would continue to provide assistance and support.", "012": "[12]\nThe Applicants submit the following issues:\n1. Did the RAD err by failing to analyse the new evidence that refutes the RPD's credibility findings?\n2. Did the RAD err by rejecting the psychotherapist reports?\n3. Did the RAD err in its IFA analysis?", "028": "[28]\nHowever, contrary to the Applicants' submissions, the RAD did consider the Riback Report. It did not dispute its clinical impression, but afforded it little weight because: the impression of the psychotherapist was based on a single 60-90 minute interview; its findings were based on self-reporting by the female Applicant and made no reference to the application of any additional clinical testing; and, because it offered no medical basis for its opinion. The RAD concluded that without a clinical basis upon which the opinion was formed it amounted to speculation based on self-reporting. In this regard I would note that the Riback Report states that the female Applicant was traumatised by the threats and abuse suffered at the hands of her ex-husband and that she would not be able to work through the past events and trauma as long as there was a threat of return to India. The author stated that she believed that returning to India would put the female Applicant in serious physical danger and would very likely cause her mental and physical stress symptoms to increase considerably, causing her psychological and emotional state to deteriorate. Further, that the family in whole would likely face danger and significant trauma if returned and that it was in their best interest to remain in Canada. If the female Applicant were to remain in Canada, then a plan of medical and therapeutic care could be implemented.", "030": "[30]\nThe Choi Report was prepared by a psychiatrist and postdates the Riback Report. It acknowledges the Riback Report and concurs with its clinical impression.", "036": "[36]\nFurther, as stated in\nMomodu\nand\nAbdalghader\n, the onus or burden of proof is on the Applicants to prove that no IFA exists or that the proposed IFA is unsuitable. In the absence of evidence that the female Applicant would be unable to obtain the recommended treatment and medication in the proposed IFA, this aspect of the RAD's decision falls within the possible, acceptable outcomes (see for example,\nAlves Dias v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\n2012 FC 722 at para 22;\nGonzalez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\n2008 FC 1259 at para 12 [\nGonzalez\n]).", "004": "[4]\nThe Applicants then decided to take a holiday to Canada and applied for visas on June 19, 2014.

On June 23, 2014 the Applicants went to a different area to await their Canadian visas, which were issued on June 24, 2014. They arrived in Canada on June 28, 2014.

The RAD's consideration of the\nGender Guidelines\nwas also reasonable as it considered the social and cultural context of these Applicants. It was based on the existence of familial support and state protection, as demonstrated by the Applicants' prior experiences with the police. The RAD acknowledged the mixed evidence on state protection, but determined that in this particular case with these particular Applicants, the presumption of state protection was not rebutted.

As set out in\nIrshad\n, above, at paragraph 21, the concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition. In order to be considered a Convention refugee, an individual must be a refugee from a country, not from a region of a country. Therefore, where an IFA is found, a claimant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection (see\nSarker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration)\n, 2005 FC 353, [2005] F.C.J.

The family moved about 60 kilometers away from their home in Delhi and had no further contact with Subhas until 2013 when he located and contacted them. In particular, the Applicants describe an encounter outside their daughter's school with Subhas, accompanied by six tall Sikh men who the Applicants claim were \"fanatical Sikhs\". The male and female Applicants went to the school and confronted Subhas who said that he wanted to take Cheheleena back and that she should marry a Sikh. Further, because she was attending a good school, she would make a good salary in the future, and, as her father, he was entitled to that money. The male Applicant called the police who attended but stated that they did not want to be involved in a private matter concerning religion. After the police departed Subhas threatened to kill the female Applicant, but the Applicants did not report his threat to the police.

That is the only reason advanced. As I read the evidence, the factual origin of this new allegation is the expert evidence of Robert G.

That is, Novopharm now argues that Eli Lilly's patents on the patent list in question do not contain claims for the medicine itself nor for the use of the medicine. However, in its notice of allegations concerning these patents Novopharm simply put an 'x' beside the ground stated in the form as follows:\n'No claim for the medicine itself and no claim for the use of the medicine would be infringed by the making, constructing, using or selling by that person of the drug for which the submission for the notice of compliance is filed.'\n\"It's extremely brief 'statement of legal and factual basis' in respect to each patent was to the effect that the process used by Novopharm does not involve the use of the process claimed in the particular patent in question. In other words it appears from the notice of allegations that Novopharm is denying infringement of the process claims in Eli Lilly's patents because Novopharm's processes are different. Now Novopharm argues as the basis of its motion to strike that there is no infringement because Eli Lilly's patents contain no claims for the medicine itself nor for the use of the medicine: they contain only process claims. This is a significantly different issue. It is true that Eli Lilly has had some time to file evidence to refute this line of argument which commenced to be asserted by Novopharm some weeks after Lilly's originating notice of motion was filed. I am however unwilling to say at this point that Lilly has failed to confront in a timely fashion the evidence put forward by Novopharm.\n\"Indeed it appears to me that for Novopharm to attack Lilly's originating notice of motion in this fashion it must first amend its notice of allegations.

In this case, the respondent claims that it has yet to make a disciplinary decision concerning Mr. Basra.\n\"[99] I note that paragraph 209(1)(b) of the\nAct\nuses the words 'disciplinary action' and not 'disciplinary decision.' The word 'action' is broader than 'decision' and is a word capable of embracing the CSC's decision to appoint investigators and indefinitely suspend an employee as part of that investigation. The CSC has suspended Mr. Basra indefinitely based on an allegation of a serious wrongdoing that the CSC determined must be investigated. Clearly, the decision to suspend was part of a disciplinary process, although the CSC has not yet convened a disciplinary hearing or reached a final conclusion on discipline. The respondent's documents establish that an investigator was appointed to convene a disciplinary investigation (Exhibit E-8).\n\"[100] Also, an indefinite suspension prevents an employee from working. It is an interruption of the employee's right to work. In this case the disruption of work, as well as the loss of wages, are penalties; they are disciplinary actions that flow directly from the CSC's decision to convene an investigation and suspend Mr. Basra without pay:\nMassip v.

The tribunal's finding Mr. Aryan was reluctant to acknowledge his financial obligations to Canada and Ontario stems from misreading the evidence. Mr. Aryan testified he was never under the impression of defaulting because, at his doctor's suggestion, he, with his parents, approached Ontario. According to his evidence, not challenged by the tribunal, he told Ontario officials of his sponsorship undertaking and his continued desire to help. Ontario agreed he could afford to contribute $200 a month (he was earning $1,200 a month). Ontario deducted $200 a month from their disability entitlement, which was his agreed to contribution.

After landing in Canada in 1989, Mr. Aryan, who had received medical training in Russia before fleeing Afghanistan in 1986, found full time work in Canada from 1989 to mid 1991 as an assistant manager at a Mac's Milk store in Toronto earning $20,000 per annum but he was laid off in 1991 when the store closed;\n2. While on unemployment insurance, and on the advice of the UI officer, he took a six-month course at Centennial College training as a health care aide and then found work later that year (1991) as a health care worker;\n3. In September of 1992 he enrolled as a special student at the University of Toronto (U of T) aiming to earn a bachelor of science which he did in 1996 after receiving certain credits for his studies in Russia where he had to travel to in 1995 in order to obtain his course transcripts. During his studies, he continued to work as a health care worker;\n4. His parents were landed in Canada in April of 1993 but shortly thereafter they unexpectedly became ill (his father suffered from high blood pressure; his mother is arthritic; both later suffered strokes). With the applicant's assistance they made application under the Ontario Disability Support Plan and received $1,000 to $1,200 per month from August 1, 1993. It was agreed by Ontario Social Services with Mr. Aryan he would support his parents providing them $200 per month based on his income of $12,000 per year, (he was working part time during his attendance at U of T) an amount which was deducted from his parents' social assistance benefits.\n5. His undertaking to the Minister ended in 1998. The applicant continues to support his parents increasing funding to $1,000 per month; his parents are still the disability support plan.\n6. The record indicates his parents needed a van to get around and this was purchased in 1994 by the applicant paying $2,000 down and the rest ($28,000) on installments which he has paid off. For his own needs, he purchased in 1995 a used 1991 Pontiac paying $700.\n7. His parents, since landing, have resided with their daughter in a rented bungalow, splitting the rent. She drives the van to get her parents about.\n8. In 1996 after obtaining a post-graduate scholarship Mr. Aryan enrolled in a Masters degree program in Education and earned a degree in 1998. He continued to work throughout his studies.\n9. He currently works at two jobs, one as a staff instructor at a long term care centre and the other, during the evenings, as an instructor in a health care support college. His current annual income is in the neighbourhood of $75,000.\n10. The applicant does not own any real estate, lives in a one-bedroom rented apartment. He is paying $300 to $400 per month to his wife in Pakistan and is paying off accumulated student loans, now totalling $40,000, at the rate of $516 per month.

In the United Kingdom, you have been been (sic) residing illegally for a number of years, you have been employed illegally and have not been paying taxes, thereby showing disrespect for UK immigration, employment and tax law.

I understand that the Immigration Officer, in her affidavit, has attempted to cast a different light on the concerns which she expressed in her letter but, in my view, it is not open to her to change the grounds upon which an application has been refused. That is what has been attempted here. I would only add that I do not deny that the applicant's failure to pay taxes in the United Kingdom might conceivably become relevant under the heading of \"Personal Suitability\" if it were expressed and considered only from the point of view that he was unable to support himself except by failing to pay taxes.

She also notes that the Board's decision cited the UNHCR passage which states that removal to Sri Lanka should only occur after each case is examined on the merits of the applicant's own circumstances.", "057": "[57]\nIn conclusion, I am of the view that the Board did not properly assess Mrs. Anthonimuthu's credibility and the plausibility of her claim, and that these findings are sufficiently central to the Board's analysis to require that the decision be set aside. No question will be certified.", "023": "[23]\nThe applicant argues that there are a number of errors in the Board's decision. The first is that the Board relied on the finding that the applicant was not credible, because she came to Canada to be with her children.", "014": "[14]\nOn the second ground, the Board finds it not plausible that the LTTE would demand such a large amount of money, even if the applicant had children living abroad. The Board claims that there is no reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large sums of money in Colombo during the period of time alleged by the claimant, nor was there evidence that elderly Tamils were mistreated by any authority. The Board finds that the applicant's allegation of extortion is not supported by the documentary evidence. The Board finds that the applicant came to Canada to be with her children.", "044": "[44]\nThe respondent closes the IFA argument by stating that, a claimant will not merit protection if the government of the country of origin is capable of providing the necessary protection within its territory and where it may reasonably be expected that, having taken all the circumstances into consideration, the person can move to that part of the territory. The respondent says the onus is on the applicant to show why the IFA is unreasonable, and submits that the applicant, in this case, has failed to do so.\nANALYSIS", "005": "[5]\nIn 1995, the army attacked Jaffna, where the applicant was living. The applicant and her family were displaced to St. Thomas Church at Point Pedro, where there was a shortage of food and medicine. The applicant's husband became very ill.", "026": "[26]\nThe applicant goes on to argue that the finding that the extortion was not plausible was also erroneous. The applicant says that the Board's ground for finding that the extortion did not take place was that the amount was too high. She says that the Board erred because there was no evidence of the quantum of money that the LTTE extorts from people in Sri Lanka. She testified that the LTTE knew she had four children abroad, and she submits that approximately CDN$ 16,000 is not an 'exorbitant' amount of money among four Children living in Canada.", "055": "[55]\nIn its decision, the Board focused on the fact that the Applicant was previously raised in Colombo, was educated in English (which is still the language of commerce), could receive medical care, would be able to worship in her choice of religious facility, and receives a government pension. But all of this would be of little comfort if she is really at risk of being the victim of extortion at the hands of the LTTE. It must be remembered that the Applicant is an elderly woman of 76, with no relatives in Colombo to protect her.", "021": "[21]\nThe Board's final issue is consolidated grounds. The Board finds that, since it did not find the applicant's well-founded fear of persecution to be credible or objectively well-founded, it must also fail on the grounds of a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and danger of torture.\nISSUES", "032": "[32]\nThe applicant makes a brief argument regarding a typo (claimants, plural, instead of claimant, singular, in the decision), stating that this section of the reasons may have been taken from another case. The applicant cites Bojaxhi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 516, which states, at para 12, that the Court will not correct an error that goes to the heart of the decision, when the Board has not taken steps to make the amendments required to correct the problem.", "038": "[38]\nThe applicant closes on the IFA issue by stating that the Board failed to consider a material fact - that she is a 76-year-old woman, who, if returned to Sri Lanka, would be returning on her own, without a male protector. The applicant submits that the Board erred in finding a reasonable IFA in Colombo.", "054": "[54]\nHad the Applicant been able to establish a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, she would also have to show that this risk exists in the part of Sri Lanka specified in the IFA - Colombo. Again, it is well established that an individual need not pursue an Internal Flight Alternative if it is not objectively reasonable to do so or if it would cause undue hardship. In other words, and to quote Linden JA, \"an IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option\" (Thirunavukkarasu v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 F.C. 589 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 14).", "017": "[17]\nThe Board finds that there is no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be persecuted in Colombo because of her Tamil ethnicity.", "015": "[15]\nAfter credibility, the Board goes on to analyze the possibility of an IFA in Colombo, where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada. The Board notes that the documentary evidence pertaining to Colombo has changed over the last two years. The Board cites the Directorate Information and Refugee Board Issue Paper on Sri Lankan developments since the February 2003 cease-fire, issued in March 2003. The Board bases the Colombo IFA on two points: (1) the Colombo registration requirements are no longer in effect, which means that since 2002, there has been no complaints of police officers demanding registrations; and (2) In Colombo, most checkpoints and roadblocks were dismantled by January 2003, which in turn means that there were no reports of \"round-ups\" of Tamils in Colombo between October 2002 and March 2003.", "010": "[10]\nThe Board found her not to be a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, on February 3, 2004.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW", "008": "[8]\nShe was approached by the LTTE in Colombo, in May 2003, for the sum of twelve lakhs (approximately CDN$16,000) because she had children living abroad. She was told that, if she did not pay, she would be taken to Vanni and put in a bunker, just as they did to her husband in 1994.", "035": "[35]\nThe applicant also goes on to argue that the test for s. 97(1)(a) of the IRPA is different (and lower) from the test for section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, and definitely lower than the test under section 96. Focusing on the use of the word \"risk\" in section 97(1)(b), the Applicant contends that it is a standard quite a bit lower than the reasonable chance test that is used in the context of section 96.", "047": "[47]\nThe least that could have been expected from the Board was to give its reasons for casting doubt upon the applicant's credibility (Hilo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.); Mui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. no. 1294 (F.C. T.D.). In the present case, the Board concluded that the claimant came to Canada in order to be with her children, and rejected rather summarily her allegation of being a victim of extortion. The summary rejection was based on the implausibility of such an \"exorbitant\" amount of money, and an absence of evidence that elderly Tamils were being extorted in Colombo.", "013": "[13]\nThe delay in claiming is related to the 12 days between the applicant's arrival, and her refugee claim. The Board says it accepts the applicant's explanation of medical reasons.", "039": "[39]\nThe respondent submits that the test is higher under section 97(1) than under section 96 of the IRPA.", "056": "[56]\nFinally, there was some discussion as to the proper standard to be used in assessing the risk under section 97(1)(b). This was indeed a question that was certified for an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal under section 74(d) of the Act. Fortunately, we now have the benefit of the Court of Appeal's views, as they decided in Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 1, that the degree of risk under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b), is \"more likely than not\". Rothstein J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, also noted that the standard of proof to be applied, under both section 96 and section 97 of the IRPA, is the balance of probabilities test. The Board did not err in applying the balance of probabilities test, but, as it erred in the credibility finding, the decision must be set aside.", "006": "[6]\nAt this point, the applicant's son attempted to help her and her husband, and tried to sponsor them so that they could come to Canada. They went to Colombo to await the result of the sponsorship application. The sponsorship was rejected because the son did not have enough income.", "043": "[43]\nThe respondent says that the Board did note that the applicant had siblings in Vanni, and the north, but argues that the siblings are not the reason why the Board found a valid IFA in Colombo. The respondent says the Board found an IFA in Colombo based on the documentary evidence, and the applicant's personal circumstances. The personal circumstances included the fact that Colombo was the place where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada, that the applicant was educated in Sri Lanka at a time when English was one of the languages, and that she could receive medical care, and worship at the religious facility of her choice in Colombo.", "020": "[20]\nThe Board then goes on to the second prong of the two-prong test in Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 F.C. 706 (FCA) is met. The second part of the test is that conditions in that part of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge there. The Board says that the applicant has previously resided in Colombo, could receive medical care, and would be able to worship at a religious facility of her choice. The Board also notes that the applicant receives a government pension through her deceased husband's employment. The Board says there is no documentary evidence to indicate that hostilities between the LTTE and the government have recommenced.", "002": "[2]\nThe applicant, Mary Philomena Nesaratnam Anthonimuthu, is a 76-year-old citizen of Sri Lanka. She bases her well-founded fear of persecution on her ethnicity, and membership in a particular social group, namely Tamils who are extorted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).", "048": "[48]\nBearing in mind the words of caution of Muldoon J. in Valtchev, supra, and considering that terrorist organizations do not always act rationally, I do not find that twelve lakhs (1,200,000 rupees or approximately CDN$16,000) is an implausible amount of extortion. Indeed, the evidence reveals that the LTTE demanded up to 1,000,000 rupees for the release of kidnapped businessmen in 2001; (Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, U.S. Department of State, 2002, at page 6; Application Record, page 47). Since the LTTE knew that the Applicant had four children living in Canada, it is far from obvious that the claimant could not have been threatened with detention unless she paid 1,200,000 rupees.", "053": "[53]\nSince I have already concluded that the Applicant's allegations with respect to the threat of extortion have not been dealt with adequately by the Board, and were dismissed without much explanation, I can not rule out the possibility that the Applicant may have at least an arguable case under section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The deficiencies within the Board's credibility findings, in the context of section 96 undermine its findings under section 97.", "049": "[49]\nAs to the absence of reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large amounts of money in Colombo at the time alleged, nor that elderly Tamils were mistreated, the evidence is at best ambiguous. The U.S. Department of State Report mentions that the LTTE was responsible for extortion without confining this finding to a specific geographical zone. The Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board also reported in 2003 that, \"as a consequence of the ceasefire and the resulting ability of the LTTE to now move freely in government controlled areas, the LTTE has reportedly been able to extend its extortion activity into new territory, particularly the towns of Batticaloa and Karaitivu\".", "011": "[11]\nThe Board found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, for the following reasons:\na.

The Board found that because there was no more than a mere possibility of persecution, a claim under s. 97 had to be ruled out. The applicant cites Bouaouni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C. 1211 as authority that section 97 requires a separate analysis, given that there was credible evidence.", "009": "[9]\nThe applicant came to Canada on July 5 2003, and filed for refugee protection on July 17, 2003.", "012": "[12]\nThe Board challenges the applicant's credibility on two grounds:\n(a) a delay in claiming refugee status, and (b) plausibility of the applicant's story.", "028": "[28]\nThe applicant also points out that sworn statement by an applicant are presumed to be true, unless there is a juridical reason to find otherwise, and submits that absence of corroboration is not such a reason.", "030": "[30]\nThe respondent replies that the Board is entitled to make findings regarding plausibility of a claim, and it is in the best position to do so, having had the opportunity to see and hear from the applicant, and to assess the evidence as regards the allegations and assessments, which lie within the expertise of the Board. The respondent says the applicant has failed to show that the Board's findings were perverse of capricious.", "051": "[51]\nThe Applicant also contends that the Refugee Division erred in not assessing her claim under section 97 of the IRPA, taking it for granted that she must fail on the grounds of a risk to like or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and danger to torture if she could not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. This Court has repeated on a number of occasions that the analysis under section 97 is different from the analysis required under section 96 and that claims made under both sections therefore warrant separate treatment. The Court said, in Bouaouni, supra, at paragraph 41:\nIt follows that a negative credibility determination, which may be determinative of a refugee claim under s. 96 of the Act, is not necessarily determinative of a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. The elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 of the Act where a well-founder [sic] fear of persecution to a convention ground must be established. Although the evidentiary basis may well be the same for both claims, it is essential that both claims be considered as separate.", "036": "[36]\nAs a consequence, the applicant argues that the test for s.96 was inappropriately applied, in that the word \"would\" was used in the test. The phrase used by the Board is: \"The panel finds that there is not more than a mere possibility that the claimants [sic] would be persecuted in Colombo\". The applicant says that the use of the word \"would\" creates the impression that a balance of probabilities test was used.", "004": "[4]\nThe applicant says her family suffered a lot due to ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka.

Because the legislation contem\u00adplates that names on the eligibility list will be ranked by order of merit, there is an issue as to merit between the appellant and each person whose name which appears above his or hers. The order of placement of the name on the list reflects a determination of relative merit as between the appellant and each of those candidates. Since each person whose name appears on the list above that of the appellant should be appointed prior to the appellant, each of those persons represents a successful candidate from the point of view of the appellant. That is certainly so at the time the list is created. Is there a rationale for dealing with the list at some date other than the date of its creation? The successful candidate is defined by reference to being placed on the list ahead of the appellant, a state of affairs which came into being at the time the list was created. Subsequent events do not alter the relative ranking. More im\u00adportantly, subsequent events do not alter the fairness and consistency of the ranking. If disclosure is intended to allow a candidate to confirm that the merit principle has been applied, the material time for disclosure ought to be the time when the merit prin\u00adciple was to be applied which is the time of creation of the list.

Kazmar's request amounts to a request for disclosure of material which pertains to all persons whose names were placed on the eligibility list from which appointments were to be made. Is each of those persons\nthe\nsuccessful candidate? Once they come off the eligibility list, because of appointment in another competition or for any other reason, do they cease to be a successful candidate. Or, put another way, at what point in time is the determination of the identity of the successful candidate to be made?", "023": "[23]\nThe\nAct\ncontemplates that eligibility lists will be prepared from which appoint\u00adments will be made to positions [see foot\u00adnote 1]. The fact of being placed on the eligibility list does not mean one will be appointed but one cannot be appointed if one's name does not appear on the list. In that context, at what point does a person whose name appears on the eligibility list become a successful candidate? Successful candidate is defined in s. 20 of the\nRegula\u00adtions\nas a person whose name appears on the eligibility list and \"who has been or is about to be appointed\". But as this matter demon\u00adstrates, who is about to be appointed is a function of when the question is asked. Should this be left to the vagaries of who is still eligible for appointment at the time an appeal is launched? Is some other rationale more persuasive?", "014": "[14]\nThe expression \"liable to be disclosed before the appeal board\" is a curious turn of phrase. One does not ordinarily speak of documents being disclosed before a tribunal. Disclosure is a practice which occurs at the pre-hearing stage when the parties exchange relevant documents for the purpose of nar\u00adrowing the issues in the litigation. In my view, the expression must be read in the context of a provision which is attempting to define which documents are to be made available to an appellant. The first require\u00adment is that the documents must contain information which pertains to the candidates. This does not necessarily mean relevant information since the information must simply \"pertain\" to the appellant or to the successful candidate. The second require\u00adment, that the document is liable to be dis\u00adclosed before the appeal board, should there\u00adfore be read so as to import the requirement of relevance, since it is relevance which determines whether a document will be accepted as evidence before a tribunal. In my view, the phrase \"liable to be disclosed before the appeal board\" should be read as meaning \"by reason of its relevance, capable of being introduced as evidence before the appeal board.\"", "005": "[5]\nThis dispute arises in the context of certain provisions under the\nAct\nand\nRegula\u00adtions\npromulgated pursuant to the\nAct\n:\n\"\nAppeals\n\"21(1) Where a person is appointed or is about to be appointed under this Act and the selection of the person for appointment was made by closed competition, every unsuccessful candidate may, within the period provided for by the regulations of the Commission, appeal against the ap\u00adpointment to a board established by the Com\u00admission to conduct an inquiry at which the person appealing and the deputy head concerned, or their representatives, shall be given an opportunity to be heard.\n\"21(1.1) Idem\n\"(1.1) Where a person is appointed or about to be appointed under this Act and the selection of the person for appointment was made from within the Public Service by a process of personnel selection, other than a competition, any person who, at the time of the selection, meets the criteria established pursuant to s. 13(1) for the process may, within the period provided for by the regulations of the Commission, appeal against the appointment to a board established by the Commission to conduct an inquiry at which the person appealing and the deputy head concerned, or their representatives, shall be given an opportu\u00adnity to be heard.\n\"21(2) Duty of Commission when notified of decision\n\"(2) Subject to subs.

The basis of the decision was that the manual did not contain information specific to a candidate. This ruling was made in the course of a case where the primary issue was whether the Appeal Board could distinguish, for purposes of disclosure, between the appellant and his/her representative. Richard, J., concluded that there was no basis for such a distinction so that if the scoring manual was subject to disclosure, it would have to be given to the appellant himself.

Without recourse to the scoring manual, Kaczmar and his representatives would have access to certain test papers which have been scored but would not be able to assess the consistency of scoring.

Having his fears allayed does not assist in that process. The scoring man\u00adual contains information which pertains to the applicant and to the successful candidate, in that recourse to the scoring handbook is necessary to make sense of the candidates' test results.

The implied reference to all rele\u00advant materials arises from the reference to s. 24(1) which uses the words \"document that contains information ... that is liable to be disclosed before the appeal board.\"", "002": "[2]\nThe facts are straightforward. Kaczmar challenges a competition in which one of the selection tools was a standardized test, In-Basket Exercise 820. The result of the com\u00adpetition was that 19 candidates were found qualified for appointment to the position in question, Team Coordinator, Audit. Kaczmar was not among them and exercised his right of appeal under s. 21 of the\nAct\n. It appears that Kaczmar did not meet the minimum score for In-Basket Exercise 820 whereas most of the successful candidates had scored 20 or more out of 30. Naturally enough, Kaczmar is curious as to how the In-Basket Exercise is scored, given his anomalous result. His request for disclosure of the test materials was met by a refusal on the part of the Public Service Commission to provide access to the materials or copies of it except upon terms which Kaczmar found unaccept\u00adable. The grounds of the Public Service Commission's refusal was that disclosure would prejudice the continued use of the standardized test. According to the Chairper\u00adson's reasons, the foundation for this claim was the assertion of a common sense prop\u00adosition that if Kaczmar was given access to materials in which the candidate scored very high, it would be tantamount to giving him an answer sheet and would give him an unfair advantage in any subsequent writing of the test. On that basis, the Chairperson made an order as to disclosure which reads as follows:\n\"1. The appellant's representative, present\u00adly Dave Riffel of the Professional Institute of the Public Service, will be given unlimited time to review the test materials. The appellant, Mr. Kaczmar will be restricted to a period of 20 minutes of review for each test paper. Neither Mr. Riffel nor Mr. Kaczmar will be given access to the scoring manual for the IBE 820. Access to the scoring manual and test materials including the papers of Mr. Kaczmar and the successful candidates, will be given to an individual of the appel\u00adlant's choosing, who has appropriate quali\u00adfications to review and evaluate the test and scoring manual.\n\"2. Mr. Riffel will be allowed to take unrestricted personal notes and photocopies of the materials presented to him during disclosure. He may retain them in his possession for the purpose of this appeal, subject to his undertaking to maintain confidentiality of those materials, and subject further to paragraph 4 below.\n\"3. The appellant will be subject to a waiting period of 180 days before being permitted to write the IBE 820. This period will run from the last occasion on which he sees the test materials, whether at disclosure or at the hearing of his appeal.\n\"4. At the conclusion of the hearing into the merits of this appeal, all materials relevant to the IBE 820 in the possession of the appellant, his representative, and any other person to whom they may have been disclosed pursuant to paragraph 1, will be placed in a sealed envelope, to be retained on the Public Service Commission Appeal Board file. This will include their personal notes.\n\"5. In the event of an application for judi\u00adcial review, the materials will be returned to the appellant's representative, on request. In the event that the period for judicial review expires without further application, the test materials will be returned to the Personnel Psychology Centre of the Public Service Commission, on request. The personal notes will be destroyed.\"", "011": "[11]\nHasan\nwas considered by McGillis, J., in\nMurphy v. Canada (Attorney General)\n, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1843; 161 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.). The learned judge undertook a long and detailed examination of the disclosure provi\u00adsions in the\nRegulations\nmade pursuant to the\nAct\nas they existed from time to time and con\u00adcluded that the scoring manual likely was subject to disclosure if, on the facts, it was relevant to the matter in dispute:\n\"30.

I cannot accept that argu\u00adment. In my opinion, the amended legisla\u00adtive scheme was designed in order to balance the competing interests of the appellant in receiving full disclosure and of the government in protecting the confiden\u00adtiality and integrity of the standardized tests. In order to achieve the appropriate balance, the amended\nRegulations\nprovide for full disclosure to an appellant, recog\u00adnizing that circumstances nevertheless may exist in which disclosure should be refused or granted subject to conditions in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the standardized test. Indeed, the amend\u00adments clearly contemplate that documents or information pertaining to a standardized test will be subject to disclosure; other\u00adwise, there would be no necessity for the provisions granting discretionary powers to the deputy head, Commission and appeal board in relation to standardized tests. The scoring manual is one of the documents directly related to the administration and use of the standardized test and, as such, may be information or a document '... that pertains to the appellant or to the success\u00adful candidate and that is liable to be dis\u00adclosed before the appeal board', within the meaning of s. 24(1). The question of whether a scoring manual ought to be disclosed to an appellant under s. 24(1) depends on its relevance in the context of the facts of the case. However, even if the scoring manual is subject to disclosure on the facts of a particular case, the deputy head or the Commission and the appeal board may exercise their various discre\u00adtionary powers under the amended\nRegula\u00adtions\n.\"", "009": "[9]\nCounsel for Kaczmar points out that the psychologist is not the one who will have to cross-examine witnesses with respect to the test and its application. The order made by the Chairperson amounts to providing Mr. Kaczmar with an independent assessment of the test, but limits his ability to make use of that information in the adversarial forum where his rights will be determined. One is reminded of Rothstein, J.'s (as he then was), comments in\nBarton and Watkins v. Canada (Attorney General)\n(1993), 66 F.T.R. 54, at p. 57.\n\"[14] The adversarial nature of the pro\u00adceedings in this case have been described in\nWiebe v.

The situation was aptly described by Catta\u00adnach, J., in the Trial Division [\nMillward v. Public Service Commission,\n[1974] 2 F.C. 530, at p. 539] as follows:\n\"While there is not a lis inter parties [sic] in the true sense of that term, there is, nevertheless, a contest between two parties. The deputy head is before the board to justify that the selection of the successful candidate was on the basis of the merit system and the un\u00adsuccessful candidate is present to estab\u00adlish that this was not the case. Such situation has been described and estab\u00adlished by authority as a quasi-lis between quasi-parties.\"\n'In such adversarial proceedings, parties are entitled to be represented. Such rep\u00adresentation must be effective, in the sense that counsel or representative must have an opportunity of knowing what evidence will be given by the witnesses that he or she will call. He or she must have the opportunity of reviewing the evidence of the expert witness, of orga\u00adnizing the evidence, of ensuring that the evidence is coherent, of emphasizing its best features and of preparing the witness for cross-examination. These are the normal functions of counsel. Without access to all relevant information and in particular, the confidential information upon which the expert evidence would be based and upon which the witness could be cross-examined, counsel or a representative cannot properly perform the task of persuading the court or tribu\u00adnal as to the merits of the client's case.'\n\"[15] In this case, the Appeal Board, in its decision, ignored this role of counsel or representative by limiting disclosure only to a person who could give evidence before the tribunal. In making such a ruling, the Appeal Board erred by denying the applicants the right to have their repre\u00adsentative, who was in charge of managing and conducting their case, know the same information that would be known be known by his potential witness. While the Appeal Board's concern with confidential\u00adity was appropriate, it was an error for the Appeal Board to limit disclosure in the manner it did.\"", "012": "[12]\nIn her reasons, McGillis, J., notes that the practice of the Public Service Commis\u00adsion, prior to\nHasan\n, was to disclose the scoring manual as a matter of course, subject to conditions designed to protect the continu\u00ading utility of the test. That history puts the question of disclosure of the scoring manual into perspective.", "004": "[4]\nThe Attorney General of Canada seeks judicial review of that part of the order allowing Kaczmar's representative to take notes and photocopies of the test material. Kaczmar brings his own application for judicial review of the decision to withhold production of the scoring manual to his representative and well as from the withhold\u00ading of the test results of individuals who have since accepted other positions. Both applications will be dealt with in these rea\u00adsons.", "025": "[25]\nFor the reasons set out above, it is hereby ordered that:\n1 - the matter of access to the scoring manual is remitted to the Chairperson to be dealt with in accordance with these rea\u00adsons.\n2 - no copies or notes amounting to a transcription are to be allowed with respect to those matters in respect of which objec\u00adtion has been taken pursuant to s. 24(3) of the\nPublic Service Employment Regula\u00adtions 1978\n.\n3 - the applicant is entitled to access to the test papers of all candidates whose names appeared on the eligibility list at the date of its creation, notwithstanding the fact that as of the date of the hearing some may no longer be eligible for appointment.\nOrder accordingly.", "001": "[1]\nPelletier, J.\n: Merlin Kaczmar (\"Kacz\u00admar\") is an employee of Revenue Canada in Calgary, Alberta.

P-33 (the \"\nAct\n\") he launched an appeal against the selection for employment made in that competition.", "016": "[16]\nThe second issue is whether Kaczmar or his representative is entitled to make notes amounting to a transcription or to take copies of the scoring manual and other test materials or is he limited to access to the material?", "003": "[3]\nIn addition the Chairperson excluded from the materials to be disclosed the test materials of a number of candidates who had been appointed to positions as a result of an earlier closed competition or had declined appointment. It was her position that in the result, none of these individuals could be appointed to the position which was the subject of the competition and accordingly, they could not be considered to be a success\u00adful candidate.", "007": "[7]\nDealing with Kaczmar's application first, he objects to the denial of access to the scoring manual and the exclusion of names from the list of candidates whose test materials will be disclosed."}, "decision": "this Court had the opportunity to interpret Regulation 24 and concluded that it required an Appeal Board Chairperson to decide three issues before ordering access to confidential materials associated with a standardized test"}}
